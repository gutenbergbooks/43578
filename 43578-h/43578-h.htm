<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>


<p>The publication of the concluding volumes of
the "Introduction to Entomology" has been unavoidably
delayed by the continued ill health of
one of the Authors, which has devolved upon the
other a considerable increase of labour, and demanded
a greater expenditure of time than would
otherwise have been required: for though Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spence</span> put every facility in Mr. <span class="smcap">Kirby's</span> power,
and had drawn up a rough copy of every Letter
belonging to his department; yet, as most of
them had been written several years ago, many
curious facts, and a great variety of interesting
information subsequently derived from various
sources, were necessarily to be inserted, and the
whole to be prepared for the press.</p>

<p>When the thousands of objects that were to be
examined, and many of them repeatedly, in composing
the Letters on the External Anatomy of
Insects, are considered, it will not appear surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
if some errors should have crept in; especially
as Mr. <span class="smcap">Kirby</span> was deprived of the effectual
help formerly derived from the acumen, learning,
and judgement of his esteemed coadjutor, by his
lamented and protracted indisposition: but it is
hoped that these errors will be found of minor
importance, and not to affect any general principles
advanced. The same remarks are also in
part applicable to the Anatomical and Orismological
Tables (<span class="smcap">Vol.</span> III. p. 354-393, and <span class="smcap">Vol.</span> IV.
p. 257-354), which were drawn up by the Authors
jointly many years ago, before any other
portion of the work was composed, but which
have, especially the former, required considerable
alterations and additions in consequence of subsequent
observations and information.</p>

<p>It will not be amiss here to state, in order to
obviate any charge of inconsistency in the possible
event of Mr. <span class="smcap">Kirby's</span> adverting in any other
work to this subject, that though on every material
point the authors have agreed in opinion, their
views of the <i>theory of instinct</i> do not precisely
accord. That given in the second and fourth
volumes is from the pen of Mr. <span class="smcap">Spence.</span></p>

<p>It was originally intended, as mentioned in the
Preface, to have given a complete list of Entomological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
works, of which a large portion was drawn
up; but the great length to which more important
matters have extended, has rendered necessary
the intire omission of this list,&mdash;an omission in
some degree compensated by the catalogue of
<i>Authors quoted</i>, which comprises most of the
standard Entomological works.</p>

<h4>DIRECTIONS TO THE BINDER.</h4>

<p>The Synoptical Table of the Nomenclature of the Parts of the
External Crust of Insects should be placed opposite to page 354.</p>

<p>Plates VI-XX. should be placed in this Volume, and the remainder
in the Fourth.</p>

<p>It is however suggested to Purchasers, that in binding complete
Sets of the Work, a separate Volume may be formed of the Synoptical
Table, the Plates and their Explanations, and the Indexes.</p>

<h3><i>DEFINITION OF THE TERM</i> INSECT.</h3>


<p>What is an insect? This may seem a strange question
after such copious details as have been given in my
former Letters of their history and economy, in which it
appears to have been taken for granted that you can <i>answer</i>
this question. Yet in the scientific road which you
are now about to enter, to be able to define these creatures
technically is an important first step which calls for
attention. You know already that a butterfly is an insect&mdash;that
a fly, a beetle, a grasshopper, a bug, a bee, a
louse, and flea, are insects&mdash;that a spider also and centipede
go under that name; and this knowledge, which
every child likewise possesses, was sufficient for comprehending
the subjects upon which I have hitherto written.
But now that we are about to take a nearer view of them&mdash;to
investigate their anatomical and physiological characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
more closely&mdash;these vague and popular ideas are
insufficient. In common language, not only the tribes
above mentioned, but most <i>small</i> animals&mdash;as worms,
slugs, leeches, and many similar creatures, are known by
the name of <i>insects</i>. Such latitude, however, cannot be
admitted in a scientific view of the subject, in which the
class of insects is distinguished from these animals just as
strictly as beasts from birds, and birds from reptiles and
amphibia, and these again from fishes. Not, indeed,
that the just limits of the class have always been clearly
understood and marked out. Even when our correspondence
first commenced, animals were regarded as
belonging to it, which since their internal organization
has been more fully explained, are properly separated
from it. But it is now agreed on all hands, that an
earthworm, a leech, or a slug, is not an insect; and a
Naturalist seems almost as much inclined to smile at
those who confound them, as Captain Cook at the islanders
who confessed their entire ignorance of the nature of
cows and horses, but gave him to understand that they
knew his sheep and goats to be birds.</p>

<p>You will better comprehend the subsequent definition
of the term <i>Insect</i>, after attending to a slight sketch of
the chief classifications of the animal kingdom, more especially
of the creatures in question, that have been proposed.
That of Aristotle stands first. He divides animals
into two grand sections, corresponding with the <i>Vertebrata</i>
and <i>Invertebrata</i> of modern Zoologists: those,
namely, that have blood, and those that have it not<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:&mdash;by
this it appears that he only regarded <i>red</i> blood as
real blood; and probably did not suspect that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
a true circulation in his <i>Mollusca</i> and other white-blooded
animals. His <i>Enaima</i>, or animals that have blood, he
divides into <i>Quadrupeds</i>, <i>Birds</i>, <i>Fishes</i>, <i>Cetacea</i>, and
<i>Apods</i> or reptiles; though he includes the latter, where
they have four legs, amongst the quadrupeds<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; and his
<i>Anaima</i>, or animals without blood, into <i>Malachia</i>, <i>Malacostraca</i>,
<i>Ostracoderma</i>, and <i>Entoma</i>. The first of
these, the <i>Malachia</i>, he defines as animals that are externally
fleshy and internally solid, like the <i>Enaima</i>; and
he gives the <i>Sepia</i> as the type of this class, which answers
to the <i>Cephalopoda</i> of the moderns. The next, the <i>Malacostraca</i>,
synonymous with the <i>Crustacea</i> of Cuvier and
Lamarck, are those, he says, which have their solid part
without and the fleshy within, and whose shell will not
break, but splits, upon collision<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. The <i>Ostracoderma</i>, corresponding
with the <i>Testacea</i> of LinnÃ©, he also defines as
having their fleshy substance within, and the solid without;
but whose shell, as to its fracture, reverses the character
of the <i>Malacostraca</i>. He defines his last class
<i>Entoma</i>, in Latin <i>Insecta</i>, with which we are principally
concerned, as animals whose body is distinguished by <i>incisures</i>,
either on its upper or under side, or on both, and
has no solid or fleshy substance separate, but something
intermediate, their body being equally hard both within
and without<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. This definition would include the <i>Annelida</i>
and most other <i>Vermes</i> of LinnÃ©, except the <i>Testacea</i>,
which accordingly were considered as insects by those
Zoologists that intervened between Aristotle and the latter
author. The Stagyrite, however, in another place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
has expressly excluded all <i>apods</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. From other passages
in his works, it appears that he regarded the <i>Vermes</i>, &amp;c.
either as <i>larvÃ¦</i>, or as produced spontaneously and not
<i>ex ovo</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>This definition of an insect, though partly founded on
misconception, as well as his primary division of animals
in general, is by no means contemptible. If you look at
a bee or a fly, you will observe at first sight that its body
is <i>insected</i>, being divided as it were into three principal
pieces&mdash;head, trunk, and abdomen<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; and if you examine
it more narrowly, you will find that the two last of these
parts, especially the abdomen, are further subdivided.
And this character of <i>insection</i>, or division into segments,
more or less present in almost every insect<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, is not to be
found (with the exception of the <i>Crustacea</i>, which Aristotle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
distinguishes by the nature of their integument
and its contents) in any of the other classes into which
he divided animals without blood. It was on account of
this most obvious of their characters, that these little
creatures were in Greek named <i>Entoma</i>, and in Latin
<i>Insecta</i>; and from the former word, as you know, our
favourite science takes the name of <i>Entomology</i>.</p>

<p>Pliny adhering to the definition of Aristotle, as far as
it relates to the <i>insection</i> of the animals we are speaking
of, expressly includes <i>Apods</i>, as well as <i>Aptera</i>, amongst
them<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; and in this was followed, without any attempt at
improvement, by all the entomological writers that intervened
between him and the great Aristotle of the moderns,
LinnÃ©.</p>

<p>This illustrious naturalist, aware of the incorrectness
of the primary divisions of the animal kingdom founded
upon the presence or absence of blood, establishes his
system upon the structure of the heart, and upon the
temperature and colour of the circulating fluid. He divided
animals into two great <i>sections</i> or <i>sub-kingdoms</i>,
each comprising two <i>classes</i>. His <i>first</i> section included
those having a heart with <i>two</i> ventricles, <i>two</i> auricles,
and <i>warm</i> and red blood, viz. the <i>Mammalia</i> or beasts,
and the <i>Aves</i> or birds. His <i>second</i>, those having a heart
with <i>one</i> ventricle, <i>one</i> auricle, and <i>cold</i> and red blood,
namely, the classes <i>Amphibia</i>, which included reptiles,
serpents, &amp;c. and <i>Pisces</i> or fish. His <i>third</i>, those having
a heart with <i>one</i> ventricle and <i>no</i> auricle, and <i>cold white</i>
sanies in the place of blood, namely, his classes <i>Insecta</i>
et <i>Vermes</i>, including the <i>Invertebrate</i> animals of Lamarck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Thus the first of Aristotle's great divisions he
increased by the addition of a new and very distinct class,
the <i>Amphibia</i>, by which some ground was gained in the
science; but as much was lost by his compressing the
four classes of which the last consisted into two, by which
the natural classes of <i>Cephalopoda</i> and <i>Crustacea</i> merged
under <i>Insecta</i> and <i>Vermes</i>. LinnÃ© was not aware of the
extraordinary fact, that the <i>Cephalopoda</i> have three
hearts; and that though the <i>Crustacea</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>
have a circulation, <i>Insects</i> have none, or he would never
have taken this retrograde step.</p>

<p>Indeed LinnÃ©'s definition of an <i>Insect</i> is, in many
most material points, inapplicable, not only to the <i>Crustacea</i>,
but to many other animals included under that
denomination. This will appear evident from a very
slight examination. Thus it runs: "<i>Polypod animalcula,
breathing by lateral spiracles, armed every where
with an osseous skin, whose head is furnished with movable
sensitive antennÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>." Now of this definition only
the first member can be applied to the whole class which
it is meant to designate; for the entire genus <i>Cancer</i> L.,
which, with some others, forms the class <i>Crustacea</i> of the
moderns, does not respire by <i>spiracles</i> at all, but by <i>gills</i>;
and the same in some degree may be said of spiders,
scorpions, &amp;c. With the last member of the definition
LinnÃ© himself must have been aware that a large number
of what he conceived to be insects were at variance, as
mites, spiders, and many other of his apterous tribes:
though from some very recent observations of M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Latreille<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, there seems some ground for thinking, that in
these the antennÃ¦ are represented by the mandibles,
palpi, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, and to the soft flexible, coriaceous or membranous
skin of a vast number of insects, the term <i>cutis
ossea</i> is by no means applicable.</p>

<p>Evident as these incongruities are, when the Herculean
task which LinnÃ© imposed upon himself, and the vastness
and variety of his labours, are considered, they become
very venial. Indeed, unless he had divided his class <i>Insecta</i>
into two or more, it was impossible to define it intelligibly
to ordinary readers, otherwise than nearly in
the terms which he actually employed; and these characters,
restricted and amended by qualifying clauses, are
still those to which recurrence must be had in a popular
definition of the class, when separated as it ought to be
from the <i>Crustacea</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>.</p>

<p>Pennant, Brisson, and other zoologists, who, attending
to <i>nature</i> rather than <i>system</i>, saw the impropriety of uniting
a crab or a lobster in the same class with a bee or a
beetle, long since assigned the <i>Crustacea</i> their ancient
distinct rank. "But these changes," as Latreille observes<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>,
"being only founded upon <i>external</i> characters,
might be deemed arbitrary; and to fix our opinion, it
was necessary to have recourse to a decisive authority&mdash;the
<i>internal</i> and comparative organization of these animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>"
It results from the observations of the most profound
comparative anatomist of our age, M. Cuvier, that
the <i>Crustacea</i> and <i>Arachnida</i> differ from insects properly
so called, and particularly from those that are furnished
with wings, in having a complete system of circulation,
a different mode of respiration, and that they have a more
perfect organization. Influenced by these motives, both
Cuvier and Lamarck have considered them as forming
two classes separate from insects. Treviranus, led by
considerations founded on the organs of circulation, of
respiration, and of generation, is of opinion that spiders
and scorpions ought to form one class with the <i>Crustacea</i>:
he observes, however, that the nervous system of all three
is very dissimilar; and that in an arrangement founded
on this circumstance, the organs of motion, and the external
shape, even spiders and scorpions must be placed
in different classes<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>It is to be observed with regard to the <i>Arachnida</i> of
the French school, that the class as laid down by them
includes several animals that have no circulation, and
breathe by <i>tracheÃ¦</i>, of which description are the mites
(<i>Acarus</i> L.), and the harvest-men (<i>Phalangium</i> L.) &amp;c.;
and therefore it has been divided into two orders, <i>Pulmonaria</i>
and <i>Tracheana</i>; but if the definition from the
internal organization be adhered to, the latter should
either remain with the class <i>Insecta</i>, or form a new one by
themselves. Yet the animals that compose the <i>Trachean</i>
order of <i>Arachnida</i>, their external form considered, are
certainly much more nearly related to the spiders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
scorpions than to any members of the class <i>Insecta</i> at
present known. This circumstance, perhaps, may seem
to throw some doubt upon the modern system of classification.</p>

<p>I must further observe, that the assertion of Treviranus,
which appears to intimate that the respiration of the <i>pulmonary
Arachnida</i> is the same with that of the <i>Crustacea</i>,
is not quite correct, since in the latter the <i>branchiÃ¦</i> or
gills are <i>external</i>, and in the former <i>internal</i>, the air entering
by spiracles before it acts upon them<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss in this place to lay before you the
principal points in which the <i>Crustacea</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>
agree with <i>Insecta</i>, and also those in which they differ.</p>

<p>The <i>Crustacea</i> agree with <i>Insecta</i> in having a body
divided into segments, furnished with jointed legs, compound
eyes, and antennÃ¦. Their nervous system also is
not materially different, and they are both oviparous.
They differ from them in having the greater insections
of the body less strongly marked; in the greater number
of legs on the trunk, the anterior ones performing
the office of maxillÃ¦: in their eyes usually on a
moveable footstalk: their palpigerous mandibles; and
their four antennÃ¦ at least in the great majority. But
the principal difference consists in the internal organization
and the fountains of vitality; for the <i>Crustacea</i> have
a double circulation, the fountain of which is a heart in
the middle of their thorax<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. They have too a kind of
gizzard and liver, at least the <i>Decapods</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, and their respiration
is by gills. Genuine insects terminate their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
existence after they have laid their eggs<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; but the <i>Crustacea</i>
live longer, and lay more than once.</p>

<p>The <i>Arachnida</i> will be found to differ from insects
more widely than even the <i>Crustacea</i>. They agree in
their jointed legs and palpi; immoveable eyes; and in
being covered with a coriaceous or corneous integument:
but they differ in having a system of circulation; gills
instead of tracheÃ¦; their organs of generation double;
and the females lay more than once in their lives. Their
head also is not distinct from the trunk as in insects;
they have no compound eyes; and their antennÃ¦, if we
admit the opinion on this head of MM. Latreille and
Treviranus, that they have representatives of these organs,
differ totally in structure, situation, and use, from
those of the great body of insects. In the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i> or
Spiders, their body seems to have no segments or incisure
but that which separates the abdomen from the trunk;
and in the <i>ScorpionidÃ¦</i> they are observable only in the
abdomen. Other particulars might be enumerated in
which these two classes differ from insects; but these will
be sufficient to convince you that Aristotle and MM. Cuvier
and Lamarck were justified in separating them.</p>

<p>The two last-mentioned authors made further improvements
in Zoology. The latter, from the consideration of
the general structure of animals, perceiving that Aristotle's
<i>Enaima</i> were distinguished from his <i>Anaima</i>, by
being built as it were upon a vertebral column, very judiciously
changed the denomination, which was indeed
improper, of "<i>The Philosopher's</i>" two sub-kingdoms, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that of <i>Vertebrata</i> or animals that have a vertebral column,
and <i>Invertebrata</i> or those that have no vertebral
column. These he distributes into three primary divisions
according to their supposed degrees of <i>intelligence</i>&mdash;Thus:</p>

<p>Profiting by the light afforded by the Aristotelian system,
this eminent zoologist improved, we see, upon that
of LinnÃ©, by resolving his <i>Insecta</i> into three classes, and
his <i>Vermes</i> into seven, interposing the Linnean <i>Insecta</i>
between the four first and three last, in which he was
not so happy, since as to <i>sense</i> insects should certainly
occupy the place he has here assigned to the <i>Mollusca</i>.</p>

<p>In the work from which I have taken this statement
of Lamarck's system, that acute writer has given a sketch
of another method of arrangement, in which he has made
the first deviation from the beaten track of an unbroken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and unbranching series. In the Supplement to the first
volume, he has distributed the <i>Invertebrata</i> in a double
subramose series&mdash;one consisting of <i>articulate</i>, and the
other of <i>inarticulate</i> animals<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>Upon Lamarck's system, most of the modern ones,
with some variation, are founded. There is one, however,
by a learned countryman of ours, that is more
unique, <i>sui generis</i>, and I may add profound, than any
that has yet appeared. I am speaking of that, you will
perceive, of which our friend Mr. Wm. MacLeay has
given a detailed statement in his <i>HorÃ¦ EntomologicÃ¦</i>.
In this he goes even far beyond what Lamarck has attempted
in the above sketch, and substantiates his claim
to be considered as one of those original thinkers, <i>rari
nantes in gurgite vasto</i>, that do not appear every day.
The following are the principal bases of his system.</p>

<p>1. That all natural groups, whether kingdoms or any
subdivision of them, return into themselves; a distribution
which he expresses by circles.</p>

<p>2. That each of these circles is formed precisely of
<i>five</i> groups, each of which is resolvable into five other
smaller groups, and so on till you reach the extreme term
of such division.</p>

<p>3. That proximate circles or larger groups are connected
by the intervention of lesser groups, which he denominates
<i>osculant</i>.</p>

<p>4. That there are relations of analogy between the
corresponding points of contiguous circles.</p>

<p>This system he has represented by tables of circles
inscribed with the five primary divisions of each group.
His first table exhibits a general view of organized matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
as distributed in the animal and vegetable kingdoms&mdash;Thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="Animal_Vegetable_Kindoms" id="Animal_Vegetable_Kindoms"></a>
   <img src="images/i_023.png" alt="Animal Vegetable Kindoms" title="Animal Vegetable Kindoms" />
</div>

<p>Our learned author here divides the animal kingdom
into what may be denominated five sub-kingdoms or provinces,
in three of which (with the exception of the <i>Crustacea</i>
and <i>Arachnida</i> belonging to his <i>Annulosa</i>) no circulation
of blood is visible, but which obtains in the rest.
These he names&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Acrita</span>, consisting of the <i>Infusory Animals</i>, the
<i>Polypi</i>, the <i>Corallines</i>, the <i>TÃ¦niÃ¦</i>, and the least organized
of the <i>Intestinal Worms</i>.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Radiata</span>, including the <i>Jelly-fish</i>, <i>Star-fish</i>, <i>Echini</i>,
and some others.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Annulosa</span>, consisting of <i>Insecta</i>, <i>Arachnida</i>, and
<i>Crustacea</i>.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Vertebrata</span>, consisting of <i>Beasts</i>, <i>Birds</i>, <i>Reptiles</i>,
<i>Amphibia</i>, and <i>Fishes</i>.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Mollusca</span>, including the numerous tribes of <i>shell-fish</i>,
<i>land-shells</i>, <i>slugs</i>, &amp;c., which, from their mucous or
gelatinous substance, from their nervous system and the
imperfection of their senses, return again to the <i>Acrita</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
though connected with the <i>Vertebrata</i> by having a heart
and circulation.</p>

<p>His next set of circles shows the sub-division of these
five sub-kingdoms into classes&mdash;Thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
   <a name="Animal_Sub_Kindoms" id="Animal_Sub_Kindoms"></a>
   <img src="images/i_024.png" alt="Animal Sub Kindoms" title="Animal Sub Kindoms" />
</div>

<p>In this scheme the <i>osculant</i> classes are those placed
between the circles. In the <i>Mollusca</i> circle two classes
are still wanting to complete the quinary arrangement
of that sub-kingdom. I am not sufficiently conversant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
with the details of the animal kingdom at large to hazard
any decided opinion upon Mr. MacLeay's whole system,
or to ascertain whether all these classes are sufficiently
distinct<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. My sentiments with regard to those of the
<i>Annulosa</i> I shall state to you hereafter.</p>

<p>Upon a future occasion I shall consider more at large
the station to which insects seem entitled in a system of
invertebrate animals, which will not accord exactly with
that assigned by MM. Cuvier and Lamarck. But I am
now in a field in which I have no intention to expatiate
further, than as it is connected with the subject of the
present letter. I shall therefore confine myself in what
I have more to say to the definitions of <i>Insecta</i> that have
been given by modern authors, beginning with that of
the zoologist last mentioned. Insects form a part of his
<i>second</i> group, which he terms <i>sensitive</i> animals (<i>animaux
sensibles</i>), which group he thus defines: "<i>They are sentient,
but obtain from their sensations only perceptions
of objects&mdash;a kind of simple ideas which they cannot
combine to obtain complex ones.</i> Charact. <i>No vertebral
column; a brain, and most commonly an elongated medullary
mass; some distinct senses; the organs of movement
attached under the skin: form symmetrical, by
parts, in pairs</i><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>." This division of animals, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
kind and degree of sense and intelligence that they possess,
seems rather fanciful than founded in nature, since
many insects show a greater portion of them than many
vertebrate animals. Compare in this respect a <i>bee</i> with
a <i>tortoise</i><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. Lamarck divides his group of <i>animaux sensibles</i>
into two sections, namely, <i>Articulated</i> animals, exhibiting
segments or articulations in all or some of their
parts; and <i>Inarticulatcd</i> animals, exhibiting neither segments
nor articulations in any of their parts. <i>Insecta</i>,
<i>Arachnida</i>, and <i>Crustacea</i>, belong to the first of these
sections, which he defines as "<i>those whose body is divided
into segments, and which are furnished with jointed
legs bent at the articulations</i><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>." <span class="smcap">Insecta</span> he defines&mdash;"<i>Articulate
animals, undergoing various metamorphoses,
or acquiring new kinds of parts&mdash;having, in their perfect
state, six feet, two antennÃ¦, two compound eyes, and a
corneous skin. The majority acquiring wings. Respiration
by spiracles</i> (stigmates), <i>and two vascular opposite
chords, divided by plexus, and constituting aeriferous tracheÃ¦,
which extend every where. A small brain at the
anterior extremity of a longitudinal knotty marrow, with
nerves. No system of circulation, no conglomerate glands.
Generation oviparous: two distinct sexes. A single sexual
union in the whole course of life</i><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>." <span class="smcap">Arachnida</span> he
defines&mdash;"<i>Oviparous animals, having at all times jointed
legs, undergoing no metamorphosis, and never acquiring
new kinds of parts. Respiration tracheal or branchial:
the openings for the entrance of the air spiraculiform
(stigmatiformes). A heart and circulation beginning in</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
<i>many. The majority couple often in the course of life</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>."
I shall next add his definition of <span class="smcap">Crustacea</span>: "<i>Oviparous,
articulated, apterous animals, with a crustaceous integument
more or less solid, having jointed legs; eyes
either pedunculate or sessile, and most commonly four
antennÃ¦, with a maxilliferous mouth seldom rostriform;
maxillÃ¦ in many pairs placed one over the other; scarcely
any under-lip; no spiraculiform openings for respiration;
five or seven pair of legs; a longitudinal knotty marrow
terminated anteriorly by a small brain. A heart and vessels
for circulation. Respiration branchial with external
branchiÃ¦, sometimes hid under the sides of the shell of the
thorax, or shut in prominent parts; sometimes uncovered,
and in general adhering to particular legs or to the tail.
Each sex usually double</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>."</p>

<p>I have given Lamarck's definitions of these three classes,
all considered as <i>Insecta</i> by LinnÃ©, that by comparing
them together you may be better enabled to appreciate
the system of this author. On looking over the characters
of the <i>Arachnida</i> as here given, you will see at once that
it consists of heterogeneous animals&mdash;for in fact he includes
in this class not only the <i>Trachean Arachnida</i> of
Latreille, but the <i>Ametabolia</i> of Dr. Leach, or the <i>Hexapod</i>
Aptera, and the <i>Myriapoda</i>.</p>

<p>I shall next copy for you Latreille's latest definition of
<i>Insecta</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Insecta</span>: <i>A single dorsal vessel representing the
heart: two trunks of tracheÃ¦ running the whole length
of the body, and opening externally by numerous spiracles;
two antennÃ¦; very often upper appendages for
flight, indicating the metamorphosis to which the animal</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<i>is subject when young; legs most commonly reduced to
six.</i> <span class="smcap">Arachnida</span>: <i>Distinguished from</i> Crustacea <i>by
having their respiratory organs always internal, opening
on the sides of the abdomen or thorax to receive the respirable
fluid. Sometimes these organs perform the office
of lungs, and then the circulation takes place by means of
a dorsal vessel, which sends forth arterial, and receives
venose branches. Sometimes they are tracheÃ¦ or air-vessels,
which, as in the class</i> Insecta, <i>replace those of
circulation. These have only the vestige of a heart, or a
dorsal vessel alternately contracting and sending forth
no branch. The absence of antennÃ¦, the reunion of the
head with the thorax, a simple trachea but ramified and
almost radiating, serve to distinguish these last</i> Arachnida,
<i>or the most imperfect of insects, which respire only by
tracheÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>." Under this head he observes&mdash;"Of all
these characters, the most easy to seize and the most
certain would doubtless be, if there were no mistake in it,
that of the absence of antennÃ¦; but later and comparative
researches, confirmed by analogy, have convinced
me, that these organs, under particular modifications it
is true, and which have misled the attention of naturalists,
do exist<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>:" and he supposes, from the situation and direction
of the <i>mandibles</i> of the <i>Arachnida</i>, corresponding
with that of the <i>intermediate</i> pair of <i>antennÃ¦</i> in <i>Crustacea</i>,
that they really represent the latter organs. If this supposition
be admitted, their use is wholly changed; the palpi,
in fact, executing the functions of antennÃ¦, which probably
induced Treviranus to call them <i>FÃ¼hlhÃ¶rner</i> (<i>Feelinghorns</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Perhaps these last may be regarded as in some
sort representing the <i>external</i> antennÃ¦ of the <i>Crustacea</i>?
With regard to <i>Insecta</i>, their antennÃ¦ seem to disappear
in the <i>PupiparÃ¦</i> Latr., or the genus <i>Hippobosca</i> L.</p>

<p>The above definitions of the <i>Arachnida</i> by these two
celebrated authors, appear to me the reverse of satisfactory.
When we are told of animals included in it, that
some breathe by gills and others by tracheÃ¦, that some
have a heart and circulation and others not, we are immediately
struck by the incongruity, and are led to suspect
that animals differing so widely in the fountains of
life ought not to be associated in the same class. A
learned zoologist of our own country, Dr. Leach, seems
to have made a nearer approach to a classification in accordance
with the internal organization, by excluding
from <i>Arachnida</i> the <i>Acari</i> and <i>Myriapoda</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. MacLeay, on whose system I shall now say a few
words, divides his sub-kingdom <i>Annulosa</i> into five classes,
namely, <i>Crustacea</i>, <i>Ametabola</i>, <i>Mandibulata</i>, <i>Haustellata</i>,
<i>Arachnida</i>. From the <i>Crustacea</i> he goes by the genus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
<i>Porcellio</i> Latr. to <i>Iulus</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, which begins his <i>Ametabola</i>:
these he connects with the <i>Mandibulata</i>, by <i>Nirmus</i>,
which he thinks approaches some of the corticarious
<i>Coleoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. This class he appears to leave by the <i>Trichoptera</i>
Kirby, and so enters his <i>Haustellata</i> by the <i>Lepidoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>,
and leaves it again by the <i>Diptera</i> by means
of the <i>PupiparÃ¦</i> Latr., especially <i>Nycteribia</i>, connecting
this class with the <i>Arachnida</i>, which he enters by the
Hexapod <i>Acari</i> L.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, and these last he appears to leave
by the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i>, and to enter the <i>Crustacea</i> by the Decapods<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>:
thus making good his circle of classes, or a
series of Annulose animals returning into itself. Mr.
MacLeay's whole system upon paper appears very harmonious
and consistent, and bears a most seducing aspect
of verisimilitude; but it has not yet been so thoroughly
weighed, discussed, and sifted, as to justify our adopting
it <i>in toto</i> at present: should it, however, upon an impartial
and thorough investigation, come forth from the furnace
as gold, and be found to correspond with the actual state
of things in nature, my objections, which rest only upon
some parts of his arrangement of <i>Annulosa</i>, would soon
vanish. Some of those objections I will state here, and
some will come in better when I treat of the Systems
of Entomology. My first objection is, that his <i>Ametabola</i>,
<i>Mandibulata</i>, and <i>Haustellata</i>, approach much
nearer to each other than they do to the other two classes
of his circle, or than even these last to each other; so
that under this view it should primarily consist of <i>three</i>
greater groups, resolvable, it may be, into five smaller
ones. My next objection is, that he has also considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the <i>Trachean</i> and <i>Pulmonary</i> Arachnida as forming <i>one</i>
class. Whether an animal breathes by gills or tracheÃ¦,
or has a circulation or not, is surely as strong a reason
for considering those so distinguished as belonging to different
classes, as the taking of their food by suction or by
manducation is, for separating others to the full as much
or more nearly related as to their external structure.
But of this more hereafter. I cannot help, as a last objection,
lamenting that our learned author has rejected
from his system a term consecrated from the most remote
antiquity, and which, even admitting his arrangement,
might have been substituted for <i>Annulosa</i>, a name borrowed
by Scaliger from Albertus Magnus, neither of
whom, in Entomology, is an authority to weigh against
Aristotle, from whom we derive the term <i>Insecta</i>, in
Greek &#917;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#945;.</p>

<p>As Fabricius did not alter LinnÃ©'s <i>class</i> Insecta, but
merely broke up his <i>orders</i> into new ones, which he
named classes, I shall give you a detail of the alterations
he introduced into the science in a future letter.</p>

<p>Having stated what my predecessors have done in
classification, I shall next proceed to lay before you my
own sentiments as to&mdash;<i>What is an insect.</i> Since our
correspondence commenced, the <i>Arachnida</i>, principally
on account of their internal organization, have been excluded
from bearing that name, carrying with them, as
we have seen, several tribes, which as yet have not
been discovered to differ materially in that respect from
the present <i>Insecta</i>: for the sake, therefore, of convenience
and consistency, that I may, as far as the case
will admit, adhere to the Horatian maxim</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&mdash;&mdash; Servetur ad imum<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>I shall regard as <i>Insects</i> all those <i>Annulosa</i> that respire
by tracheÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and have no circulation, considering the
<i>Trachean Arachnida</i> and the <i>Myriapoda</i> for the present
as sub-classes, the one bordering upon the <i>Arachnida</i>, and
the other upon the <i>Crustacea</i>. Some of these I am ready
to own seem separated by an interval sufficiently wide
from the <i>Hexapods</i>, which may be regarded as more peculiarly
entitled to the denomination of <i>Insects</i>. The
most striking differences will be found in the coalition of
the head with the trunk in some (<i>PhalangidÃ¦</i>), and the
disappearance of the annulose form of the body in others
(<i>Acarus</i> L.), so that the legs only are jointed<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. Yet an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
approach to such structure may be traced in some Hexapods;
for instance, the coalition of the head and trunk
in <i>Melophagus</i>, Latr., and that of the trunk and abdomen
in <i>Sminthurus</i>, Latr.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The <i>Myriapoda</i> exhibit other remarkable
differences; though their head and trunk are
distinct, the former antenniferous, and their body annulose,
the abdomen as well as the trunk is furnished with
legs, sometimes amounting to hundreds; but even to this
a tendency has been observed in some Hexapods<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. If
you examine a specimen of <i>Machilis polypoda</i>, an insect
related to the common sugar-louse (<i>Lepisma saccharina</i>),
you will find that the abdomen is furnished with a double
series of elastic appendages, which, being instruments of
motion, may be regarded as representing legs. It is
worthy of notice, that the <i>Myriapoda</i> when first disclosed
from the egg have never more than <i>six</i> legs<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, and keep
acquiring additional pairs of them and additional segments
to their abdomen as they change their skins: and
it is equally remarkable, that many Hexapods are subject
to a law in some degree the very reverse of this, having
many abdominal legs in their first state, and losing them
all in their last. The union of the head with the trunk
in the <i>Trachean Arachnida</i> has been regarded as almost
an unanswerable argument, in spite of their different internal
organization, for including them in the same class
with the <i>Pulmonary Arachnida</i>; but the case of <i>Galeodes</i>,
which, though furnished with gills, (as an eminent Russian
Entomologist Dr. G. Fischer is reported to have
discovered,) implying also a circulation, and evidently
belonging to the last-mentioned class, has nevertheless a
distinct thorax consisting of more than one piece, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
are affixed only six legs<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, proves that even this circumstance
possesses no weight when set against the organization.
If it was a difference in this respect, that proved
the <i>Crustacea</i> classically distinct from <i>Insecta</i>&mdash;that likewise
was the principal reason for the separation also of
the <i>Arachnida</i>&mdash;it seems to follow that it ought also to
furnish an argument equally cogent for considering the
<i>Trachean Arachnida</i>, as well as the <i>Myriapoda</i>, distinct
from the <i>Pulmonary</i>.</p>

<p>Another difference between the tribes in question is
that of their <i>metamorphosis</i>; and this appears to have
had great weight with Lamarck, inducing him to include
in his <i>Arachnida</i>, not only the <i>Tracheans</i> and <i>Myriapods</i>,
but even the apterous <i>Hexapods</i>, except <i>Pulex</i>, or the
<i>Anoplura</i> and <i>Thysanura</i> of modern authors. But the
metamorphosis alone, unless supported by the internal
organization, will I think scarcely be deemed a sufficient
reason for separating from each other tribes agreeing in
that respect, and placing them with others with which
they disagree. The metamorphosis in some of the Hexapods
(<i>Lepidoptera</i>) consists in the loss of legs, the acquisition
of wings, a great change in the oral organs and
in the general form; in others (some <i>Coleoptera</i>), in the
acquisition only of wings and a change of shape, the oral
organs remaining much the same; in others again (<i>Curculio</i>
L.), in the acquisition of six legs and wings and a
change of form; in the flea, in the acquisition of six
legs and a change of form only; in the <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Hemiptera</i>,
&amp;c. in the mere acquisition of wings; in the
<i>LibellulidÃ¦</i>, in the loss of the mask that covers the mouth
and the acquisition of wings; in the <i>Diptera</i>, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
acquisition of six legs, wings, a change of the oral organs
and of the form; in some of the <i>Octopods</i> (<i>Acarus</i> L.),
in the acquisition of a pair of legs; and in others (<i>Phalangium</i>
and <i>Aranea</i> L.), solely in a modification of them
as to their proportions; in the <i>Myriapods</i>, the alteration
that takes place in this respect is considerable; a large
number of pairs of legs is acquired and many additional
abdominal segments, and the proportion which the abdomen
bears to the whole insect is quite altered. In all
these cases there is a change more or less, either partial
or general, of the original shape or organs of the animal;
and with regard to their metamorphosis, there is a greater
difference between a young and adult <i>Iulus</i> than between
a young and adult <i>grasshopper</i> or <i>bug</i>: so that if the metamorphosis,
<i>per se</i>, be assumed as a principal regulator of
the class, the grasshopper or bug have as little claim to
belong to it as the <i>Iulus</i>.</p>

<p>M. Lamarck lays considerable stress upon another
character&mdash;That <i>Insecta</i> engender only once in the course
of their lives, and <i>Arachnida</i> more than once. But this,
if examined, will be found to be confined chiefly to the
<i>Pulmonary Arachnida</i>, the <i>Tracheans</i> following the law
of <i>Insecta</i> in this respect<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>You may perhaps object that the bringing of the Trachean
<i>Arachnida</i> and the <i>Myriapoda</i> into the class <i>Insecta</i>
will render the approximation of them to a natural
arrangement more difficult, since it will be impossible
at the same time to connect the <i>Myriapods</i> with the
<i>Crustacea</i>, and the <i>Trachean</i> with the genuine <i>Arachnida</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
I admit the validity of your objection, but by no arrangement
of insects in a simple series can we attain this object:
the difficulty, however, may perhaps be obviated in this
way. The distribution of organized matter, to adopt
Mr. Wm. MacLeay's metaphor<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, begins in a dichotomy,
constituting the animal and vegetable branches of the
great tree of nature, and from these two great branches, by
means of infinite ramifications, the whole system is formed,
and, what is remarkable, these branches unite again
so as to represent a series returning into itself, a discovery
due to the patient investigation and acumen of our
learned friend just mentioned. Now, in considering
the <i>Aptera</i> order, we find at first setting out from the
Hexapods, a dichotomy, where the <i>Anoplura</i> Leach
branch off on the one side, and the <i>Thysanura</i> Latr. on
the other&mdash;the former, by means of the <i>PediculidÃ¦</i>, taking
their food by suction, particularly <i>Phthirus</i> Leach,
or the Morpion (in which the segments of the trunk and
abdomen become indistinct<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>) approach the <i>Octopods</i> by
the hexapod <i>Acari</i> L.&mdash;the latter by <i>Machilis polypoda</i>
tending towards the <i>Myriapods</i>. In the Octopod branch
a further dichotomy takes place, from which you proceed
on one side to the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i> in the <i>Arachnida</i>, by <i>Phalangium</i>,
&amp;c.; and in the other by <i>Chelifer</i>, &amp;c. to <i>Scorpio</i>.
Again, the <i>Myriapod</i> branch also divides, going by the
<i>IulidÃ¦</i> to one branch of the <i>Isopod Crustacea</i>, and by the
<i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i> to another.</p>

<p>But there is another view of this subject before alluded
to, which may be repeated here, and which seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
prove that the types of form in one natural group or
class are reproduced in another; this appears to result
from the following parallel series:</p>

<p>No type representing the <i>Myriapoda</i> has yet been
discovered in the <i>Arachnida</i> class; but I have little
doubt of its existence. You will observe that the analogies
between the larvÃ¦ of the <i>winged</i> orders and the
<i>Aptera</i> were first noticed by Mr. W. MacLeay<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. It is

<p>The external characters in this class are the same almost
in every respect as those which distinguish the
<i>PhalangidÃ¦</i>, the whole difference consisting almost in
the systems of circulation, respiration, and digestion.
Perhaps some future anatomist may discover in the tribe
just mentioned, that there is a nearer agreement between
them and the <i>Arachnida</i> in these systems than is at present
suspected, which would prove them true <i>Arachnida</i>.
I am inclined to think that <i>Phrynus</i> and <i>Gonyleptes</i>, &amp;c.
breathe by branchial spiracles; but having no opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of examining living specimens, I dare not speak
with any confidence on the subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having thus given you a view of the most important
diagnostics by which what we have all along called <i>Insects</i>
may scientifically be distinguished from other invertebrate
animals, it may not be without use, if, under
this head, I take a more <i>popular</i> and familiar view of
the subject, and say something upon those distinctions
which may attract the attention of the more common
observer.</p>

<p>The notion of diminutive size, particularly as compared
with vertebrate animals, seems more frequently
attached to the idea of an insect than any other; and
this notion is generally correct, for one insect that is
bigger than the least of the above animals, thousands
and thousands are vastly smaller: but there exist some
that are considerably larger, whether we take length or
bulk into consideration, and this in almost every order.
To prove this most effectually, and that you may have a
synoptical view of the comparative size of the larger
insects of the different orders and tribes, I now lay before
you a table of the dimensions of such of the largest
as I have had an opportunity of measuring, including
particularly those giants that are natives of the British
isles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>From this table you see that several insects included
in it exceed some of the smallest <i>Vertebrata</i> in bulk. In
the <i>Mammalia</i>, the <i>Sorex Araneus</i>, called by the common
people here the Ranny, is not more than two inches
long excluding the tail; and the <i>Mus messorius</i>, or harvest-mouse,
peculiar to the southern counties of England,
is still more diminutive: so that to these little animals,
the larger <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>, <i>Goliathi</i>, and <i>Prioni</i>, &amp;c., appear
giants, and may compete with the mole in size. Even some
of the beetles of our own country, as the great <i>Hydrophilus</i>,
the stag-beetle, &amp;c., are more bulky than the two
first-named quadrupeds. Amongst the birds, many <i>PicÃ¦</i>,
<i>Passeres</i>, &amp;c., yield to several insects in dimensions, and
their wings when expanded do not extend so far as those
of not a few <i>Lepidoptera</i>. The great owl-moth of Brazil
(<i>Erebus Strix</i>) in this respect is a larger fowl than the
quail. Those beautiful little creatures, the humming-birds
(<i>Trochilus</i> L.), the peculiar ornament and life of
tropical gardens, which emulate the most splendid butterflies
in the brilliancy of their plumage, are smaller
than a considerable number of insects in almost every
order, and even than some of those that are natives of
Britain. Various reptiles also are much inferior in size
to many of the insects of the above table. The smallest
lizard of this country would be outweighed by the great
British beetles lately mentioned, and the mole-cricket
(<i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>); and some of the serpent tribe are
smaller than the larger <i>ScolopendrÃ¦</i> and <i>Iuli</i>. Amongst
the <i>fishes</i> also, though some are so enormous in bulk,
others in this respect yield the palm to several insects.
The <i>minnow</i> and the <i>stickleback</i> that frequent our own
pools and streams are considerably inferior in size to
some of our water beetles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>In looking over the table, and comparing the different
species that compose it with each other, you will perceive
that the largest insects of the two sections of <i>Hemiptera</i>,
of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> as to their <i>body</i> merely, of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i>, in general size fall considerably
short of those of the other orders; and that certain individuals
of the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Aptera</i> bear away the
palm in this respect from all the rest. In the <i>Coleoptera</i>
the giants, with the exception of the <i>Goliathi</i>, are chiefly
to be found amongst the timber devourers in the <i>Lamellicorn</i>
and <i>Capricorn</i> tribes. Of orthopterous insects the
<i>PhasmidÃ¦</i> present the most striking examples of <i>magnitude</i>;
and in the <i>Neuroptera</i>, the <i>AgrionidÃ¦</i> of great
<i>length</i>.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark here, that although the tropical
species of a genus usually exceed those of colder climates
in size, the <i>Gryllotalpa</i> of Brazil is very considerably
smaller than that of Europe: whether this is the case
with the rest of the cricket tribe I have not had an opportunity
of ascertaining. The <i>Lepidoptera</i>, though often
remarkable for the vast expansion of their "sail-broad
vans," if you consider only their bodies, never attain to
gigantic bulk. Even the hawk-moths (<i>Sphinx</i> L.), though
usually very robust, make no approach to the size of
the great beetles, or the length of some of the spectres
(<i>Phasma</i>) and dragon-flies (<i>AgrionidÃ¦</i>). With regard
to the superficial contents of their wings, a considerable
difference obtains in different species where they expand
to the same length&mdash;for the <i>secondary</i> wings are sometimes
smaller than the <i>primary</i>, and sometimes they equal
them in size. In some instances, also, the latter although
long are narrow, and in others they are nearly as wide
as long: regard, therefore, should be had to their expansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
both ways. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>,
the principal giants are to be found in the predaceous or
blood-sucking tribes, as <i>Scolia</i>, the <i>SphecidÃ¦</i>, <i>PompilidÃ¦</i>,
<i>VespidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., belonging to the former order; and the
<i>AsilidÃ¦</i> and <i>TabanidÃ¦</i> to the latter. The true and false
humble bees (<i>Bombus</i> and <i>Xylocopa</i>) and the fly tribe
(<i>MuscidÃ¦</i>), though they sometimes attain to considerable
size, scarcely afford an exception to this observation.
Amongst the <i>Aptera</i> none of the <i>Hexapods</i> strike us by
their magnitude, and few of the <i>Octopods</i>, though the
legs of some of the <i>PhalangidÃ¦</i> inclose a vast area. That
in the table would with them describe a circle of six
inches diameter, though its body is little more than a
quarter of an inch in length. The <i>Myriapods</i> exceed
most insects in the vast elongation of their body, which
with their motion gives them no slight resemblance to
the serpents. In the class <i>Arachnida</i>, the bird-spiders
(<i>Mygale</i>) are amongst the principal giants, nor do the
<i>Scorpions</i> fall far short of them&mdash;both of them when alive
often alarming the beholder as much by their size as by
their aspect.</p>

<p>But as I have before observed, generally speaking, one
of the most remarkable characters of the insect world, is
the little space they occupy; for though they touch the
vertebrate animals and even quadrupeds by their giants,
yet more commonly in this feature they go the contrary
way, and by their smallest species reach the confines of
those microscopic tribes that are at the bottom of the
scale of animal life. I possess an undescribed beetle,
allied to <i>Silpha minutissima</i> E. B.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> which, though furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
with elytra, wings, antennÃ¦, legs, and every other
organ usually found in the order it belongs to, is absolutely
not bigger than the full stop that closes this period.
In several other coleopterous genera there are also very
minute species, as in <i>Cryptophagus</i>, <i>Anisotoma</i>, <i>Agathidium</i>,
&amp;c. I know no <i>orthopterous</i> insect that can be called
extremely minute, except that remarkable one found on
the Continent in the nests of ants, the <i>Blatta Acervorum</i>
of Panzer<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, but now called, I believe, <i>Myrmecophilus</i>:
nor indeed any in the <i>Hemiptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>, and <i>Diptera</i>,
that approach the extreme limits of visibility: but
in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the pygmy <i>Tinea occultella</i> is almost
invisible except in flight, being scarcely thicker than
a horse's hair, and proportionably short; indeed, many
others of those lovely Lilliputians, the subcutaneous <i>TineÃ¦</i>,
decorated with bands of gold and silver, and studded
with gems and pearls, that in larger species would dazzle
the beholder's eye, are in size not much more conspicuous.
In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> order, <i>Ichneumon Punctum</i> of
Dr. Shaw, which forms so striking a contrast to his giant
<i>Phasma dilatatum</i>, being placed together in the same
plate; and another that I possess, under the trivial name
of <i>Atomos</i>, would elude the searching eye of the entomologist
unless when moving upon glass. LinnÃ© named
the tribe of parasites to which these belong, <i>Minuti</i>,
on account of their generally diminutive size. But
these little minims, under the superintendence of Providence,
are amongst the greatest benefactors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
human race, since they keep within due bounds the various
destroyers of our produce.</p>

<p>The number of minute species of insects seems greatly
to exceed that of large ones, at least in Europe, of which
it may be asserted probably with truth, that two-thirds
are under a quarter of an inch in length, and one-third
not exceeding much a duodecimal of it. It might hold
good perhaps in <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, and
<i>Aptera</i>: but in <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Hemiptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>, and
especially <i>Lepidoptera</i>, a large proportion would be found
to exceed three lines in length. Neither can it be affirmed
of extra-European species, of those at least preserved
in cabinets, amongst which it is rare to find an
insect less than the fourth of an inch long. This, however,
must probably be attributed to the inattention of
collectors, who neglect the more minute species.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though size forms a pretty accurate distinction between
insects and the great bulk of <i>vertebrate</i> animals, it affords
less assistance in separating them from the <i>invertebrate</i>
classes, which are of every size, from the monstrous bulk
of some <i>Cephalopoda</i> (cuttle-fish) and <i>Mollusca</i> (shell-fish,
&amp;c.) to the invisible infusory animalcule: but external
characters, abundantly sufficient for this purpose,
may be drawn from the general covering, substance, form,
parts, and organs of the body. As I shall enter into pretty
full details upon this subject when I come to treat of the
external anatomy of insects, I shall here, therefore, only
give such a slight and general sketch of the distinctions
just mentioned, as will answer the end I have in view. I
must here repeat what I have before observed, and what it
is necessary that you should always bear in mind, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
that at the limits of classes and of every other natural
group, the characters begin to change, those peculiar to
the one group beginning gradually to disappear, and
those of the other to show themselves; so that it is impossible
almost to draw up a set of characters so precise
as exactly in every respect to suit all the members of any
natural group.</p>

<p>Whichever way we turn our eyes on the objects of
creation, above&mdash;below&mdash;athwart, <i>analogies</i> meet us in
every direction, and it appears clear, that the Book of
Nature is a Book of Symbols, in which one thing represents
another in endless alternation. And not only does
one animal, &amp;c. symbolize another, but even between the
parts and organs of one set of animals there is often an
<i>analogy</i> as to their <i>situation</i> and <i>use</i>, when there is little
or no <i>affinity</i> as to their <i>structure</i>&mdash;or again, the analogy
is in their <i>situation</i>, without affinity in either structure
or use. Thus certain parts in one tribe represent other
certain parts of another tribe, though as to their structure
there is often a striking disagreement. This is particularly
observable between the vertebrate and invertebrate
animals. I shall therefore, in my remarks on the general
and particular structure of insects, contrast it in its
most important points with that of the first-mentioned
tribe.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes us when we look at an
insect is its outside <i>covering</i>, or the case that incloses its
muscles and internal organs. If we examine it attentively,
we find that it is not like the skin of quadrupeds and
other <i>Vertebrata</i>, covering the whole external surface of
the body; but that in the large majority it consists of
several pieces or joints, in this respect resembling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
skeleton of the animals just named; and that even in those
in which the body appears to have no such segments, as
in many of the Mites (<i>Acarus</i> L.), they are to be found in
the <i>limbs</i>. This last circumstance, to have externally
jointed legs, is the peculiar and most general distinction by
which the <i>Insecta</i> of LinnÃ©, including the <i>Crustacea</i>, may
always be known from the other invertebrate animals<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.</p>

<p>If we proceed further to examine the <i>substance</i> of this
crust or covering, though varying in hardness, we shall
find it in most cases, if we exclude from our consideration
the shells of the <i>Mollusca</i>, &amp;c., better calculated to
resist pressure than that of the majority of animals that
have no spine. In all the invertebrate tribes, indeed, the
muscles, there being no internal skeleton, are attached
to this skin or its processes, which of course is firmer
than the internal substance; but in insects it is very often
rigid and horny, and partially difficult to perforate, seldom
exhibiting that softness and flexibility which is found
in the cuticle of birds and most quadrupeds. From this
conformation it has been sometimes said, that insects
carry their <i>bones</i> on the <i>outside</i> of their body, or have
an <i>external</i> skeleton. This idea, though not correct in
all respects, is strictly so in this&mdash;that it affords a general
point of support to the muscles, and the whole structure
is erected upon it, or rather I should say within it. The
difference here between <i>Insects</i> and the <i>Vertebrata</i> seems
very wide; but some of the latter make an approach towards
it. I allude to the Chelonian Reptiles (<i>Testudo</i> L.),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
in which the vertebral column becomes external or merges
in the upper shell. The <i>cyclostomous</i> fishes also are not
very wide of insects as to their integument. But on this
subject I shall be more full hereafter.</p>

<p>The <i>forms</i> of insects are so infinitely diversified that
they almost distance our powers of conception: in this respect
they seem to exceed the fishes and other inhabitants
of the ocean, so that endless diversity may be regarded
as one of their distinctions. But on all their variations
of form the Creator has set his seal of symmetry; so that,
if we meet with an animal in the lower orders in which
the parts are not symmetrical, we may conclude in general
that it is no insect.</p>

<p>But it is by their <i>parts</i> and <i>organs</i> that insects may be
most readily distinguished. In the <i>vertebrate</i> animals,
the body is usually considered as divided into <i>head</i>,
<i>trunk</i>, and <i>limbs</i>, the <i>abdomen</i> forming no part of the
skeleton; but in the <i>insect</i> tribes, besides the organs of
sense and motion, the body consists of <i>three</i> principal
parts&mdash;<i>Head</i>, <i>Trunk</i>, and <i>Abdomen</i>&mdash;the <i>first</i>, as was
before observed, bearing the principal organs of <i>sense</i>
and <i>manducation</i>; the <i>second</i> most commonly those of
<i>motion</i>; and the third those of <i>generation</i>&mdash;the organs of
respiration being usually common to both trunk and abdomen.
These three primary parts,&mdash;though in some insects
the head is not separated from the trunk by any
suture, as for instance in the <i>Arachnida</i>; and in others,
head, trunk, and abdomen form only <i>one</i> piece, as in some
mites,&mdash;still exist in all, and in the great majority they are
separated by incisures more or less deeply marked: this
is particularly visible in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>,
which, in this respect, are formed upon a common model;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and in the rest, with the above exceptions, it may be
distinctly traced.</p>

<p>The <i>head</i> of insects is clearly analogous to that of
vertebrate animals, except in one respect, that they do
not breathe by it. It is the seat probably of the same
senses as <i>seeing</i>, <i>hearing</i>, <i>smelling</i>, <i>tasting</i>&mdash;and more peculiarly
perhaps of that of <i>touch</i>. The <i>eyes</i> of insects,
though allowed on all hands to be organs of <i>sight</i>, are
differently circumstanced in many particulars from those
of the animals last mentioned; they are fixed, have neither
iris nor pupil, are often compound, and are without
eyelids to cover them during sleep or repose; there are
usually two compound ones composed of hexagonal
facets, but in some instances there are four; and from
one to three simple in particular orders. The <i>antennÃ¦</i>
of insects in some respects correspond with the
<i>ears</i> of the animals we are comparing with them; but
whether they convey the vibrations of sound has not
been ascertained: that they receive pulses of some kind
from the atmosphere I shall prove to you hereafter&mdash;so
that if insects do not <i>hear</i> with them in one sense, they
may, by communicating information, and by <i>aÃ«roscopy</i>, to
use Lehman's term, not directly in his sense<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, supply the
place of ears, which would render them properly analogous
to those organs. That in numbers these remarkable
organs are <i>tactors</i> is generally agreed, but this is not
their <i>universal</i> use. That insects <i>smell</i> has been often
proved; but the organ of this sense has not been ascertained.
What has improperly been called the <i>clypeus</i>,
or the part terminating the face above the upper lip
(<i>labrum</i>), is in the situation of the <i>nose</i> of the <i>Vertebrata</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and therefore so far analogous to it, and in some cases
even in form: I therefore call it the <i>nose</i>. Whether this
part represents the nose by being furnished with what
answer the purpose of <i>nostrils</i>, residing somewhere at
or above the suture that joins it to the upper lip, I cannot
positively affirm; but from the observations of M. P.
Huber, with regard to the hive-bee, it appears that at
least these insects have the organ of the sense in question
somewhere in the vicinity of the mouth, and above the
tongue<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>: analogy, therefore, would lead us to look for
its site somewhere between the apex of the nose and the
upper lip; and in some other cases, which I shall hereafter
advert to, there is further reason for thinking that
it actually resides at the apex of the nose. The organ of
<i>taste</i> in insects, though some have advanced their <i>palpi</i>
to that honour, is doubtless in some part within the
mouth analogous in a degree to the tongue and palate of
the higher animals. The organs of manducation, in
what may be deemed the most perfect description of
mouth, consist of an <i>upper lip</i> closing the mouth above,
a pair of <i>mandibles</i> moving horizontally that close its
upper sides, and a <i>lower lip</i> with a pair of <i>maxillÃ¦</i> attached
to it, which close the mouth below and on the
under sides, both labium and maxillÃ¦ being furnished
with jointed moveable organs peculiar to annulose pedate
animals, called palpi. In some tribes these organs assume
a different form, that they may serve for suction;
but though in many cases some receive an increment at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the expense of others, and a variation in form takes place,
none, as M. Savigny has elaborately proved, are totally
obliterated or without some representative<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. The organs
now described, except the upper lip, are formed after
a quite different type from those of <i>Vertebrata</i>, with which
they agree only in their oral situation and use.</p>

<p>The second portion of the body is the <i>Trunk</i>, which
is interposed between the head and abdomen, and in
most insects consists of three principal segments, subdivided
into several pieces, which I shall afterwards explain
to you. I shall only observe, that some slight analogy
may perhaps be traced between these pieces and the
vertebrÃ¦ and ribs of vertebrate animals, particularly the
Chelonian reptiles. This is most observable in <i>Gryllus</i> L.
and <i>Libellula</i> L., in which the lateral pieces of the trunk
are parallel to each other<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>. In the <i>Diptera</i> and many
of the <i>Aptera</i> most of these pieces are not separated by
sutures. Each of the segments into which the trunk is
resolvable bears a pair of jointed <i>legs</i>, the first pair pointing
to the <i>head</i>, and the two last to the <i>anus</i>. These legs
in their composition bear a considerable analogy to those
of quadrupeds, &amp;c., consisting of <i>hip</i>, <i>thigh</i>, <i>leg</i>, and
<i>foot</i>; but the last of these, the foot or <i>Tarsus</i>, is almost
universally monodactyle, unless we regard the <i>Calcaria</i>
that arm the end of the tibia, as representing fingers or
toes, an idea which their use seems to justify. <i>Acheta
monstrosa</i> and <i>Tridactylus paradoxus</i>, however<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, exhibit
some appearance of a phalanx of these organs. They
differ from them first in number, the thoracic legs being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
invariably <i>six</i> in all insects, with the exception of the
<i>Octopods</i> or most of the <i>Trachean Arachnida</i>, which have
usually <i>eight</i>. In the <i>Myriapods</i>, though there are hundreds
of <i>abdominal</i> legs, only six are affixed to the <i>trunk</i>.
Next they differ with regard to the <i>situation</i> of their legs;
for though the anterior pair or arms are analogous in
that respect, the posterior pair are not, since in <i>quadrupeds</i>
these legs are placed <i>behind</i> the abdomen, but in
<i>insects before</i> it&mdash;in fact, in the former the legs may be
considered as placed at each end of the body, excluding
only the head and tail, but in the latter in the middle.
Though they correspond with those of quadrupeds in
being in <i>pairs</i> or opposite to each other, yet their direction
with respect to the body is different, the legs of
quadrupeds, &amp;c. being nearly straight, whereas in insects
they are bent or form an angle, often very obtuse at the
principal articulations, which occasions them to extend
far beyond the body, and when long to inclose a proportionally
greater space. The <i>wings</i> are the organs of
motion with which the upper side of the trunk is furnished;
and these, though they are the instruments of
flight, are in no other respect analogous to those of
birds, which replace the anterior legs of quadrupeds, but
approach nearer, both in substance and situation, to the
fins of some fishes, and perhaps in some respects even to
the leaves of plants. M. Latreille is of opinion, That
the four wings or their representatives replace the four
thoracic legs of the decapod <i>Crustacea</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. Upon this
opinion, which shows great depth of research and practical
acumen, I shall have occasion to express my sentiments
when I come to treat more at large on the anatomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of the trunk and its members; at any rate they do not
replace the two anterior pair of legs of the hexapod
<i>Aptera</i>. When merely used as wings, they commonly
consist of a fine transparent double membrane, strengthened
by various longitudinal and transverse nervures, or
bones as some regard them, accompanied by air-vessels,
of which more hereafter, as well as of their kind and characters.
I shall only observe, that insects are known
from all other winged animals, by having <i>four</i> wings, or
what represent them, and this even generally in those
that are supposed to have only a pair. Another peculiarity
distinguishes the trunk of insects that you will
in vain look for in the vertebrate animals&mdash;these are one
or two pair of lateral <i>spiracles</i> or breathing pores. Though
the respiratory sacs, &amp;c. of birds are almost as widely
dispersed as the tracheÃ¦ and bronchiÃ¦ of insects<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, yet
their respiration is perfectly pulmonary, and nothing like
these pores is to be discovered in them.</p>

<p>The principal peculiarity of the third part of the body,
the <i>abdomen</i>, is its situation behind the posterior pair of
thoracic legs, and its rank as forming a distinct portion
of what represents the skeleton. In most insects it is so
closely affixed to the posterior part of the trunk as to
appear like a continuation of it, but in the majority of
the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>, and in the <i>Araneidan
Arachnida</i>, or spiders, it is separated by a deep incisure;
and in the first-mentioned tribe is mostly suspended to
the trunk by a footstalk, sometimes of wonderful length
and tenuity. In the <i>Mammalia</i> the <i>male</i> genital organs
are partly external; but in insects as well as in many of
the vertebrate animals, except when employed, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
retracted within the body. This part is the principal
seat of the respiratory pores or spiracles, many having
eight in each side, while others have only one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are the principal external characters which distinguish
<i>Insecta</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>, or what we have heretofore
regarded as insects, to which here may be added
another connected with their internal organization. The
union of the sexes takes place in the same manner as
amongst larger animals; and the females with very few
exceptions, more apparent than real, are oviparous.
They are, however, distinguished by this remarkable peculiarity
already alluded to, that, except in the case of
the <i>Arachnida</i>, one impregnation fertilizes all the eggs
they are destined to produce. In most cases, after these
are laid, the females die immediately, and the males after
they have performed their office, though they will sometimes
unite themselves to more than one female. One
other circumstance may be named here&mdash;that no genuine
insect or Arachnidan has yet been found to inhabit the
ocean.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this letter, it is necessary to apprize
you, that every thing which it contains relative to the
characters of insects, has reference to them only in their
<i>last</i> or perfect state, not in those preparatory ones through
which you are aware that the majority of them must pass.
The peculiar characteristics of them in these states&mdash;in the
<i>egg</i>, the <i>larva</i>, and the <i>pupa</i>, will be the subjects of my
next letters, which will be devoted to a more detailed
view of the metamorphosis of insects than I gave you
before when adverting to this subject<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XXIX" id="LETTER_XXIX">LETTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<h3><i>STATES OF INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>EGG STATE.</h5>


<p>On a former occasion I gave you a general idea of what
has been called, perhaps not improperly, the <i>metamorphosis</i>
of insects<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>; but since that time much novel and
interesting speculation on the subject has employed the
pens of many eminent Physiologists; and besides this,
the doctrine then advanced of successive developments
has been altogether denied by a very able Anatomist,
Dr. Herold, who, with a hand, eye, and pencil, second
only to those of Lyonnet, has traced the changes that
gradually take place in the structure of the cabbage-butterfly
(<i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>) on passing through its several
states of larva, pupa, and imago. It is necessary, therefore,
that previously to considering separately and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
detail the <i>states</i> of insects, I should again call your attention
to this subject, and endeavour to ascertain whether
Dr. Herold's hypothesis rests upon a solid foundation;
or whether that adopted from Swammerdam by all the
most eminent Entomologists and Physiologists since his
time can be maintained against it.</p>

<p>I shall first give you a short abstract of the new hypothesis.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Herold&mdash;<i>The successive skins of the
caterpillar, the pupa-case, the future butterfly, and its
parts and organs, except those of sex which he discovered
in the newly excluded larva, do not preexist as germes, but
are formed successively from the</i> rete mucosum, <i>which itself
is formed anew upon every change of skin from what
he denominates the</i> blood, <i>or the chyle after it has passed
through the pores of the intestinal canal into the general
cavity of the body, where, being oxygenated by the air-vessels,
it performs the nutritive functions of blood. He
attributes these formations to a</i> vis formatrix (Bildende
Kraft).</p>

<p><i>The caul or epiploon</i> (Fett-masse), <i>the</i> corps graisseux
<i>of Reaumur, &amp;c., which he supposes to be formed from the
superfluous blood, he allows, with most physiologists, to be
stored up in the larva, that in the pupa state it may serve
for the development of the imago. But he differs from
them in asserting that in this state it is destined to two
distinct purposes&mdash;first, for the production of the muscles
of the butterfly, which he affirms are generated from it in
the shape of slender bundles of fibres;&mdash;and secondly, for
the development and nutrition of the organs formed in the
larva, to effect which, he says, it is dissolved again into
the mass of blood, and being oxygenated by the air-vessels,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<i>becomes fit for nutrition, whence the epiploon appears to
be a kind of concrete chyle</i><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>Need I repeat to you the hypothesis to which this
stands opposed&mdash;<i>That every caterpillar at its first exclusion
contains within itself the germe of the future butterfly
and of all its envelopes, which successively presenting themselves
are thrown off, till it appear in perfection and
beauty, with all its parts and organs, when no further development
takes place.</i></p>

<p>I believe you will agree with me, when you have read
and considered the above abstract of Dr. Herold's hypothesis,
that in it he substitutes a name for knowledge,
talks of a <i>vis formatrix</i> because his assisted eye cannot
penetrate to the primordial essence or state of the germes
of being, and denies the existence of what he cannot discover<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.
From ancient ages philosophers have done the
same, to conceal their own ignorance of causes under a
sounding name, when they have endeavoured to penetrate
within the veil of the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, which it
is not permitted to vain man to enter. This has occasioned
the invention, not only of the term in question,
but of many others, as little meriting the appellation of
<i>Signs of ideas</i>; such as <i>Plastic Nature</i>, <i>Epigenesis</i>, <i>Panspermia</i>,
<i>Idea seminalis</i>, <i>Nisus formativus</i>, &amp;c. But upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
this subject you cannot do better than consult what the
learned Dr. Barclay has said in his admirable work <i>On
Life and Organization</i><a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, in which he has placed the
inanity, the <i>vox et prÃ¦terea nihil</i>, of such high-sounding
terms in their true light. The processes of nature in
the formation and development of the <i>f&#339;tus in utero</i>, of
the chick in the egg, of the butterfly in the caterpillar,
we in vain attempt fully to investigate; yet we can easily
comprehend that pre-existent germes, by the constant
accretion of new matter in a proper state, may be gradually
developed, but we find it impossible to conceive
how, by the action of second causes, without the intervention
of the first cause, the butterfly should be formed
in the caterpillar, unless it preexists there as a germe or
f&#339;tus. "Is it not clear," asks Dr. Virey in his lively
manner, "as Blumenbach and other Physiologists maintain,
that there is a formative power, a <i>nisus formativus</i>,
which organizes the embryo? Admirable discovery!"
says he, "which teaches us that the f&#339;tus forms itself
because it forms itself! As if you should affirm that the
stone falls because it falls<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>!" Had Dr. Herold considered
what Bonnet says with as much good sense as modesty,
he would never have imagined that his discovering the
organs of the butterfly one after the other at certain periods
in the caterpillar, was any sound argument against
their preexistence and coexistence as germes. "Organs,"
says that amiable and excellent Physiologist,
"that have no existence as to us, exist as they respect
the embryo, and perform their essential functions; the
term of their becoming visible is that which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
erroneously mistaken for the period of their existence<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>."
This has been Dr. Herold's grand error; he mistook the
commencement of the <i>appearance</i> of the organs of the
butterfly for that of their <i>existence</i>, and yet the early appearance
of the sexual organs ought to have led him to
a conclusion the reverse of that which he has adopted.</p>

<p>Dr. Virey has observed with great truth&mdash;that "Every
being has a peculiar and unique nature, which would be
impossible if the body was composed of parts made at
several intervals, and without a uniform power that acts
by concert<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>:" and every Physiologist acquainted with
the history of insects that undergo a <i>complete</i> metamorphosis
will allow, that their developments and acquisition
of new parts and organs take place according to a <i>law</i>
which regulates the number, kind, and times of them,
differing in different species, and which has had an invariable
operation, since the first creation, upon every
sound individual that has been produced into the world.</p>

<p>In consequence of this law, one species changes its
skin only <i>four</i> times, and another <i>five</i> or <i>six</i>;&mdash;in some
cases the first skins shall be covered or bristled with
hairs or spines, and the last be naked and without arms;&mdash;that
which forms the case of the pupÃ¦ shall differ in
form and substance from the preceding skins, varying in
both respects in different species; and finally the butterfly
shall invariably follow, when no other change but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
last mortal one shall take place. Can this law, so constantly
observed, be the result of a <i>blind</i> power? Or are
we to suppose that the Deity himself is always at work
to <i>create</i> the necessary organs in their time and place?
Is it not much more consonant to reason and the general
analogy of nature, to suppose that these parts and organs
exist in embryo in the newly-hatched caterpillar, and
grow and are successively developed by the action of the
nutritive fluid? In the pupa of many <i>Diptera</i> the inclosed
animal, even under the microscope, appears without
parts or organs, like a mere pulp; but Bonnet tells
us, that if boiled, all the parts of the pupa appear<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>, which
proves the preexistence of these parts even when not to
be discerned, and that nothing but the evaporation of
the fluids in which they swim is wanted to render them
visible.</p>

<p>Mr. William MacLeay has with great truth observed:
"The true criterion of animal as well as vegetable perfection
is the ability to continue the species<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>;" and in
their progress to this state certain changes take place in
the parts and organs of <i>all</i> animals and vegetables:
there is, therefore, an analogy in this respect between
them; and this analogy also furnishes another argument
against Dr. Herold's hypothesis, as we shall presently
see. These changes are of three kinds: In the vegetable
kingdom, at least in the phÃ¦nogamous classes, there
is a succession of developments terminating in the appearance
of the generative organs, inclosed in the flower;
in this kind the integuments, or most of them, are usually
<i>persistent</i>. In insects and other annulose and some vertebrate
animals, there is a succession of spoliations, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
simultaneous changes of the whole integument, till the
animal appears in its perfect form with powers of reproduction;
in this kind the integuments are <i>caducous</i>.&mdash;In
man and most of the vertebrate animals there is a gradual
action of the vital forces in different organs till they are
fitted for reproduction; accompanied, as progress is made
to the adult state, by the acquisition of certain organs,
&amp;c. as of teeth, horns, pubes, feathers, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Let us now
consider a little in detail the analogies that appear to exist
between the second and the first and third kinds. I shall
first consider the latter as the least obvious. That able,
judicious, and learned physiologist, Dr. Virey, has pointed
out no inconsiderable resemblance between the metamorphosis
of the insect, and the changes, which he denominates
a metamorphosis by metastasis, to which most vertebrate
animals are subject. In them, he observes, a state
analogous to the <i>larva</i> state begins at the exclusion of
the f&#339;tus from the womb; it is deprived of teeth, and its
viscera are only accommodated to milk: in the cornute
species the horns are in embryo: the digestive system
now preponderates, and the great enjoyment is <i>eating</i>.
A second state, in a degree analogous to that of <i>pupa</i>,
commences at the period of dentition&mdash;the teeth now
produce another modification in the intestinal canal,
which becomes capable of receiving and digesting solid
food: during this period the vital forces are all tending
to produce the perfect state of the animal; and in this
state, in man especially, the individual is <i>educated</i> and
fitted to discharge the duties of active life. Again, analogous
to the <i>imago</i> state is the age of puberty, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the complete development of the sexual powers takes
place in both sexes, and the animal has arrived at its
acme, and can continue its kind<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>: now the digestive
powers diminish in their activity, and love reigns paramount.
When this state is fully attained, no further or
higher change is to be expected, and the progress is soon
towards decay and the termination of the animal's mortal
career. So we see that in fact man and other <i>mammalia</i>,
though they do not simultaneously cast their skins like
the insect; or pass into a state of intermediate repose,
before they attain the perfection of their nature, like the
caterpillar; have their three <i>states</i>, in each of which they
acquire new parts, powers, and appetites.</p>

<p>But a more striking analogy has been traced between
the insects that undergo a complete metamorphosis and
the <i>vegetable</i> kingdom; for though the <i>primary</i> analogy
seems to be between the <i>Polypus</i> and the <i>Plant</i>, yet the
<i>secondary</i> one with the <i>Insect</i> is not by any means remote.
There are circumstances to which I shall have occasion
hereafter to call your attention, which afford some ground
for supposing, that the substance of the insect and the
vegetable partakes of the same nature, at least approximates
more nearly, than that of the insect and the vertebrate
animal; and every one who has observed these little
creatures with any attention, will have observed amongst
them forms and organs borrowed as it were from the
kingdom of Flora; and <i>vice versÃ¢</i> the Botanist, if he
makes the comparison, will find amongst his favourite
tribes many striking resemblances of certain insects.
But the analogy does not stop here; for the butterfly
and the plant appear to have been created with a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
reference to each other, both in the epoch of their
appearance and the changes that take place in them.
Thus, as Dr. Virey has observed, the caterpillar is simultaneous
with the leaf of the tree or plant on which it
feeds, and the butterfly with the flowers of which it imbibes
the nectar<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. Swammerdam, I believe, was the first
who noticed the analogy between the <i>changes</i> of the insect
and the vegetable, and has given a table in which he has
contrasted their developments, including other animals
that undergo a metamorphosis<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>: an idea which has been
generalized by Bonnet<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, and adopted and enlarged by
Dr. Virey<a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. A state analogous to that of the <i>larva</i> in
the insect begins in the plant when it is disclosed from
the seed, or springs from its hybernaculum in the bulb,
&amp;c., or is evolved from the gemma; integument after integument,
often in various forms, as cotyledon, radical,
cauline, or floral leaves, expands as the stem rises, all
which envelopes incase the true representative of the
plant, the fructification, as the various skins do the future
butterfly. When these integuments are all expanded,
the fructification appears inclosed by the calyx or corolla
as the case may be, in which the generative organs are
matured for their office&mdash;this is the bud, which is clearly
analogous to the <i>pupa</i> state of the insect. Next the calyx
and corolla expand, the impregnation of the germen takes
place, and the seed being ripened, and dispersed by the
opening of the seed-vessel or ovary of the plant, the individual
dies: thus the <i>imago</i> state of the insect has its
representative in the plant. "If we place," says Dr. Virey,
"here the egg of the insect, next its caterpillar, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
further the chrysalis, and lastly the butterfly&mdash;what is
this but an animal stem&mdash;an elongation perfectly similar
to that of the plant issuing from the seed to attain its
blossoming and propagation?"<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>There being, therefore, this general analogy in their
progress to that state in which they can continue their
species between every part of animated nature, it holds
good, I think, that the same analogy should take place
in their developments. If the adult man or quadruped,
&amp;c. is evidently an evolution of the f&#339;tus, as from microscopical
observations it appears that they are<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, if the
teeth, horns, and other parts, &amp;c. to be acquired in his
progress to that state are already in him in their embryos,
we may also conclude that the butterfly and its organs,
&amp;c. are all in the newly-hatched caterpillar. Again, if the
blossom and its envelopes are contained in the gemma, the
bulb, &amp;c. where they have been discovered<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>, it follows
analogically that the butterfly and its integuments all
preexist in its forerunner.</p>

<p>Perhaps after this view of the objections to Dr. Herold's
hypothesis, it will not be necessary to say much
with regard to the argument he draws from the change
of organs&mdash;the loss of some and the acquisition of others&mdash;since
this may readily be conceived to be the natural
consequence of the vital forces tending more and more
to the formation of the butterfly, and the withdrawing
of their action more and more from the caterpillar; I
shall not, therefore, enter further into the question, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
since the change of organs will come more regularly
under our notice upon a future occasion.</p>

<p>Winged insects, many branchiopod <i>Crustacea</i>, and the
Batracian reptiles, have been observed by Dr. Virey to
bear some analogy to the <i>mammalia</i>, <i>aves</i>, &amp;c. in another
respect. In leaving their egg, they only quit their first
integument, answering to the <i>chorion</i> or external envelope
of the human f&#339;tus; they therefore still continue a kind
of f&#339;tus, so to speak, more or less enveloped under other
tunics, and principally in their <i>amnios</i>, or the covering
in which the f&#339;tus floats in the <i>liquor amnii</i><a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. This the
butterfly does in the pupa case; and its birth from this,
under this view, will be the true birth of the animal. In
the human subject, the ova upon impregnation are said
to pass from the ovary through the Fallopian tube into
the uterus. In the insect world, upon impregnation, the
eggs pass first from the ovaries into the oviduct, answering
to the Fallopian tube, which in them terminates in
the <i>ovipositor</i>, or the instrument by which the parent
animal conveys the eggs to their proper station: there
is, therefore, nothing properly analogous to the uterus in
the insect, and the substance upon which the larva feeds
upon exclusion answers the purpose of a placenta.</p>

<p>After this general view of the most modern theories
with regard to the <i>metamorphosis</i> of insects, I shall in the
present and some following letters, treat separately of the
different states through which these little beings successively
pass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first of these is the <i>Egg state</i>, the whole class of
insects being strictly oviparous. Some few tribes indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
bring into the world living young ones, and have on that
account been considered as <i>viviparous</i>, but incorrectly,
for the embryos of none of these are nourished, as in the
true viviparous animals, within a uterus by means of a
placenta, but receive their development within true eggs
which are hatched in the body of the mother. This is
proved by the observations of Leeuwenhoek, who found
eggs in the abdomen of a female scorpion<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>; and of
Reaumur, with regard to the flesh-fly (<i>Musca carnaria</i>)
and other viviparous flies as they have been called<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. A
similar mode of production takes place in vipers and
some other reptiles, which have hence been denominated
<i>ovo-viviparous</i>, to distinguish them from the true viviparous
animals&mdash;the class <i>Mammalia</i>. By far the larger
portion of insects is oviparous in the ordinary acceptation
of the term. The ovo-viviparous tribes at present known
are scorpions; the flesh-fly and several other flies; a
minute gnat belonging to Latreille's family of <i>TipulariÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>;
some species of <i>Coccus</i>; some bugs (<i>CimicidÃ¦</i>)<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>; and most
<i>Aphides</i>, which last also exhibit the singular fact of individuals
of the same species being some oviparous and
others ovo-viviparous, the former being longer in proportion
than the latter.&mdash;Bonnet, however, is of opinion that
the eggs of the first are not perfect eggs, but a kind of
cocoon, which defends the larva, already formed in some
degree, from the cold of winter<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>When excluded from the body of the mother, or from
the egg, as has been before observed, some insects appear
nearly in the form of their parents, which, with a very
slight alteration, they always retain; others, and the
greater number, assume an appearance totally different
from that of their parents, which they acquire only after
passing through various changes. It is to these last, which
have chiefly engaged the attention of Entomologists,
that the title of metamorphoses has been often restricted.
As, however, those insects which undergo the slightest
change of form, as spiders do, undergo <i>some</i> change, and
almost all insects cast their skins several times<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> before
they attain maturity, LinnÃ© and most Entomologists, till
very recently, have regarded the whole class as undergoing
metamorphoses, and as passing through <i>four</i> different
states, viz. the Egg&mdash;the Larva&mdash;the Pupa&mdash;and
the Imago.</p>

<p>It is obvious, however, that in ovo-viviparous species
<i>three</i> states of their existence only come under our cognizance,
as these, being hatched in the body of the
mother, come forth first under the form of larvÃ¦. There
is even one tribe of insects which presents the strange
anomaly of being born in the <i>pupa</i> state. This is the
Linnean genus <i>Hippobosca</i> (<i>Pupipara</i> fam. Latr.), to
which our forest-fly belongs, the females of which lay
bodies so much resembling eggs, that they were long
considered as such until their true nature was ascertained
by Reaumur (most of whose observations were confirmed
by De Geer), who, from their size, which nearly equals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
that of the parent fly&mdash;from their slight motion when
first extruded&mdash;from spiraculiform points which run down
each side of them&mdash;and lastly, from their producing not
a larva, as all other insects' eggs do, but perfect flies in
the winged state&mdash;inferred, and doubtless with reason,
that they are not real eggs, but pupÃ¦, or larvÃ¦ just ready
to assume the pupa state, which, however strange it may
seem, have passed the egg and larva states in the body
of the mother<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.</p>

<p>Insects, therefore, as to their mode of birth, may be
divided into&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <i>Ovo-viviparous</i>, subdivided into&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="text-indent:-1em">1. <i>Larviparous</i>, coming forth from the matrix of the
mother in the state of larvÃ¦, as the Scorpion
(<i>Scorpio</i>), the Flesh-fly (<i>Musca</i>), the Plant-louse
(<i>Aphis</i>), &amp;c.</p>

<p style="text-indent:-1em">2. <i>Pupiparous</i>, continuing in the matrix of the mother
during the larva state, and coming forth in
that of <i>pupa</i>, as the Forest-fly (<i>Hippobosca
equina</i>), the Sheep-louse (<i>Melophagus ovinus</i>),
the Bat-louse (<i>Nycteribia Vespertilionis</i>), &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>II. <i>Oviparous</i>. All other insects.</p>

<p>Our business for the remainder of this letter will be
with the latter description of these little animals.</p>

<p>The unerring foresight with which the female deposits
her eggs in the precise place where the larvÃ¦, when excluded,
are sure to find suitable food; and the singular
instruments with which, for this purpose, the extremity
of their abdomen is furnished, have been noticed in a
former letter<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, and those last mentioned will be adverted
to in a future one. I shall now, therefore, confine myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to other circumstances connected with the subject, arranged
for the sake of order under several distinct heads,
as&mdash;their <i>exclusion</i>&mdash;<i>situation</i>&mdash;<i>substance</i>&mdash;<i>number</i>&mdash;<i>size</i>&mdash;<i>figure</i>&mdash;<i>colour</i>&mdash;and
<i>period of hatching</i>.</p>


<p>i. <i>Exclusion.</i> The exclusion or extrusion of the impregnated
eggs takes place, when, passing from the ovary
into the oviduct, they are conducted by means of the
ovipositor, in which it terminates, to their proper situation.
By far the greater number of insects extrude them
<i>singly</i>, a longer interval elapsing between the passage of
each egg in some than in others. In those tribes which
place their eggs in groups, such as most butterflies and
moths, and many beetles, they pass from the ovaries
usually with great rapidity; while in the <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i>,
<i>SphegidÃ¦</i>, <i>&#338;stri</i>, and other parasitic genera, which usually
deposit their eggs singly, an interval of some minutes,
hours, or perhaps even days, intervenes between the extrusion
of each egg. One remarkable instance of the
former mode I noticed in my letter on the <i>Perfect Societies</i>
of Insects<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>; another may be cited, to which you may
yourself be a witness&mdash;I allude to that common moth,
vulgarly called the <i>Ghost (Hepialus Humuli)</i>, which lays
a large number of minute black eggs, resembling grains
of gunpowder, and ejects them so fast that, according to
De Geer, they may be said to <i>run</i> from the oviduct, and
are sometimes expelled with the force of a popgun<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. A
Tetrapterous insect, the genus of which is uncertain, is
said, when it is taken, to discharge its eggs like shot from
a gun<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. And a friend of mine, who had observed with attention
the proceedings of a common crane-fly (<i>Tipula</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
assured me that several females which he caught projected
their eggs to the distance of more than ten inches.</p>

<p>A few <i>Diptera</i> extrude them in a sort of chain or
necklace, each egg being connected by a glutinous matter
with that which precedes and follows it. In a small
species of a genus allied to <i>Psychoda</i> (a kind of midge),
which one season was abundant in a window of my house,
this necklace is composed of eggs joined by their sides,
not unlike those strung by children of the seeds of the
mallow<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. Other <i>TipulidÃ¦</i> on the contrary extrude their
eggs joined end to end, so as to resemble a necklace of
oval beads. <i>Beris clavipes</i> and <i>Sciura ThomÃ¦</i>, two other
flies, produce a chain about an inch long, consisting of
oval eggs connected, in an oblique position, side by side;
an arrangement very similar prevails in the ribband of
eggs which drop from some of the <i>EphemerÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>These eggs, like those of the insects first mentioned,
though connected, are expelled in succession; but other
tribes, as the <i>LibellulidÃ¦</i>, with the exception of <i>Agrion</i>,
many <i>EphemerÃ¦</i>, <i>Trichopterous</i> insects, &amp;c. expel the
whole at once, as it were in a mass. In those first mentioned
they are gummed together in an oblong cluster<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.
In one <i>Ephemera</i> mentioned by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, they formed
two oblong masses, each containing from three to four
hundred eggs, and three and a half or four lines long.
These animals as soon as their wings are developed eject
these masses by two orifices, and are aided in the process
by two vesicles full of air, wherever they happen to alight
or to fall; in most instances it is the water, their proper
element, that receives them, but the animal does not appear
to know the difference between a solid and a liquid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and seems only anxious how to free herself from a burthen
that oppresses her; all has been contrived that an
insect so short-lived may finish her different operations
with the utmost celerity: the term of her existence would
not have admitted the leisurely extrusion of such a number
of eggs in succession<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. Some <i>Trichoptera</i>, or May-flies,
as <i>Phryganea grandis</i> L., exclude their eggs in a
double packet, enveloped in a mass of jelly, (a circumstance
often attending the eggs that produce aquatic
larvÃ¦,) upon the leaves of willows<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. A similar double
packet in the year 1810 I observed appended to the anus
of a black species with long antennÃ¦, probably <i>Phryganea
atrata</i> F.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Upon taking several of the females I
was surprised to find in the above situation a seemingly
fleshy substance of a dirty yellow. At first, from its annular
appearance, I conceived it to be some parasitic
larva, but was not a little surprised upon pulling it away
that it was full of globular transparent dusky eggs: it
was about two lines and a quarter in length and nearly
one in breadth. Being bent double it was attached to
the animal by the intermediate angle, and when unfolded
was constricted in the middle<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. Each half, which
was roundish, had about ten sharp transverse ridges,
the interstices of which appeared as if crenated, an appearance
produced by the eggs which it contained.
Upon more than gentle pressure it burst and let out
the eggs. Though resembling the packet of <i>P. grandis</i>
in shape and other circumstances, it was nothing like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
jelly, but had rather a waxy appearance, and seems to
have been covered by a membrane: so that the excluded
larvÃ¦ must probably have eaten their way out
of it. I have still by me, in 1822, specimens of these
egg-packets, which, after the lapse of so many years, retain
their original form and colour. It is not improbable
that other species extrude their eggs in a similar case.
Scopoli says of <i>P. bicaudata</i> L., that the female carries
about under her belly her eggs united into a globe, like
<i>Lycosa saccata</i><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. The eggs of <i>Geometra Potamogata</i> F.
are also enveloped in a gelatinous substance, and the
mass is covered with leaves<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.</p>

<p>Insects of the <i>Diptera</i> order also, like frogs and toads,
commit their eggs to the water imbedded in masses of
jelly. Dr. Derham describes two different kinds of
them, in one of which the eggs were laid in parallel rows
end to end, and in another in a single row, in which the
sides were parallel<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. But the most remarkable and
beautiful specimen of this kind that I ever saw was one
that, many years ago, I took out of a pond at Wittersham
in Kent, from which I requested a young lady to make the
drawing I send you<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>. The mass of jelly, about an inch
and a quarter long, and rather widest in the middle, was
attached by one end to some aquatic grass, and from one
end to the other ran a spiral thread of very minute eggs,
the turns of the screw being alternately on each side.</p>

<p>The mode of exclusion of the eggs of the <i>BlattÃ¦</i>, which
are engaged for a whole week in the business of oviposition,
is very singular: the female deposits one or two
large suboviform capsules, as large as half their abdomen,
rounded on one side, and on the other straight and serrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
which at first is white and soft, but soon becomes
brown and hard. This egg-case, as it may be called,
contains sixteen or eighteen eggs arranged in a double
series, and the cock-roaches when hatched make their
escape through a cleft in its straight side, which shuts so
accurately when they have quitted it, that at first it appears
as entire as before<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. The insects of the genus
<i>Mantis</i> also, or what are called the <i>praying insects</i>, when
they deposit their eggs, eject with them a soft substance,
which hardens in the air and forms a long kind of envelope
resembling parchment, in which the eggs are arranged
also in a double series. And the Locusts (<i>Gryllus
Locusta</i> L.) are said by Morier<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> to deposit in the
ground an oblong substance, of the shape of their abdomen,
which contains a considerable number of eggs arranged
neatly in rows. The peristaltic motion observed
in the females of some insects during oviposition has been
before described<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.</p>


<p>ii. <i>Situation.</i> Under this head I include the situation
in which the female insect places her eggs when extruded,
whether she continues her care of them and carries them
about till they hatch, or whether she entirely deserts
them, placing them either without a covering within
reach of their food, or enveloping them in hair or otherwise
protecting them from accident or the attack of enemies.
I shall consider them under two views: <i>first</i>, as
depositing their eggs in <i>groups</i>, whether covered or naked;
and <i>secondly</i>, as depositing them <i>singly</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Those that deposit their eggs in <i>groups</i> are first to
be considered. I shall begin with those that protect them
with some kind of <i>covering</i>.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the
silken bag with which <i>Lycosa saccata</i> Latr., a kind of
spider, surrounds her eggs, and in which she constantly
carries them about with her, defending them to the last
extremity. Many other spiders, indeed nearly the whole
tribe, fabricate similar pouches, but of various sizes,
forms, texture, and colours. Some are scarcely so big
as a pea, others of the size of a large gooseberry; some
globular, some bell-shaped; others, the genus <i>Thomisus</i>
Walck. in particular, depressed like a lupine; some of a
close texture like silk; others of a looser fabric resembling
wool: some consisting of a single pellicle, but most
of a double, of which the interior is finer and softer<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>;
some white; others inclining to blue; others again yellow
or reddish; most of them are of a whole colour, but
that of <i>Epeira fasciata</i> is gray varied with black<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. And
while the parent spider of some kinds (the <i>Lupi</i>) always
carries her egg-bag attached to her anus, others hold
them by their palpi and maxillÃ¦; and others suspend
them by a long thread, or simply fasten them in different
situations, either constantly remaining near them (the
<i>TelariÃ¦</i>), or wholly deserting them (the <i>RetiariÃ¦</i>). The
eggs of one of these last Lister describes as often fixed
in a very singular situation&mdash;the cavity at the end of a
ripe cherry; and thus, as he expresses it&mdash;"<i>Stomachi
maxime delicatuli quoties hanc innocuam buccam non minus
ignoranter quam avide devorarunt</i><a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Herman informs us, that the species of the genus <i>Chelifer</i>
carry their eggs in a mass under their belly<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>Madam Merian gives an account of two species of
<i>Blatta</i>, which she affirms carry an egg-pouch about with
them&mdash;one species (<i>B. gigantea?</i>) she describes as carrying
its eggs in a globular pouch of web like certain
spiders, and the other in a brown bag, which, when
alarmed, it drops and makes off<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. But this admirable
paintress of natural objects was not always correct in her
statements<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>: it seems very improbable, from the habits
of those species of which we know the history, that any
of them should spin a pouch of web for their eggs.</p>

<p>The only insects certainly known to spin an egg-pouch
like the spiders, are the <i>Hydrophili</i>, a kind of water-beetles.
Some of these, as <i>H. lividus</i>, carry them about
with them, like <i>Lycosa saccata</i>, attached to the under
side of their body, as M. Miger observed<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>; and others
when they are finished desert them. That of the great
water-beetle (<i>Hydrophilus piceus</i>) was long ago described
and figured by Lyonnet<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>; and a more detailed account
of it has since been given by M. Miger<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. In form
it somewhat resembles a turnip when reversed, since it
consists of a pouch of the shape of an oblate spheroid,
the great diameter of which is three quarters of an inch;
and the small, half an inch, from which rises a curved
horn, about an inch long and terminating in a point<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.
The animal is furnished with a pair of anal spinners,
which move from right to left, and up and down, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
much quickness and agility: from these spinners a white
and glutinous fluid appears to issue, that forms the pouch,
which it takes the animal about three hours to construct.
The exterior tissue is produced by a kind of liquid and
glutinous paste, which by desiccation becomes a flexible
covering impermeable to water; the second, which envelops
the eggs, is a kind of light down of great whiteness,
that keeps them from injuring each other. The
tissue of the horn is of a silky nature, porous and shining,
and greatly resembling the cocoons of <i>Lepidoptera</i>. This
part, contrary to what Lyonnet supposes, appears calculated
to admit the air, the water soon penetrating it when
submerged. At its base is the opening prepared for the
egress of the larvÃ¦, when hatched, which is closed by
some threads, that, by means of the air confined in the
cocoon or pouch, hinder the water from getting in<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>.
This nidus does not float at liberty in the water till after
the eggs are hatched, the parent animal always attaching
it to some plant. By means of this anomalous process
for a beetle, which this insect is instructed by Providence
thus to perfect, the precious contents of its little ark are
secured from the action of the element which is to be the
theatre of their first state of existence, from the voracity
of fishes, or the more rapacious larvÃ¦ of its own tribe,
until the included eggs are hatched, and emerge from
their curious cradle.</p>

<p>I shall next amuse you with a few instances, in which
the Allwise Creator instructs the parent insect, instead
of defending her eggs with a covering furnished by her
internal organs, to provide it from without, either from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
her own body or from some other substance. Most
commonly, indeed, the female leaves her cluster of eggs
without any other covering than the varnish with which
in this case they are usually besmeared. Either they are
deposited in summer and will soon be hatched, or they
are of a substance calculated to encounter and resist the
severities of the season. But many species, whose eggs
are more tender or have to resist the cold and wet of
winter, defend them in the most ingenious manner with
a clothing of different kinds of substance.</p>

<p><i>Cassida viridis</i>, a tortoise beetle, RÃ¶sel tells us, covers
her group of eggs with a partially transparent membrane.
<i>Arctia Salicis</i> F., a moth, common on willows, wholly
conceals hers with a white frothy substance, which when
dry is partly friable and partly cottony, and being insoluble
in water effectually protects them from the weather<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. The
female of <i>Lophyrus Pini</i> (a saw-fly), having by means
of her double saw made a suitable longitudinal incision
in the leaf of a fir, and placed in it her eggs in a single
row end to end, stops it up with a green frothy fluid
mixed with the small pieces of leaf detached by her saws,
which when dry becomes friable: a necessary precaution,
since these eggs are extremely brittle<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. <i>Arctia chrysorh&#339;a</i>,
<i>Hypogymna dispar</i>, and several other moths, surround
theirs with an equally impervious and more singular
clothing&mdash;<i>hair</i> stripped from their own bodies. With
this material, which they pluck by means of their pincer-like
ovipositor, they first form a soft couch on the surface
of some leaf: they then place upon it successively
layers of eggs, and surround them with a similar downy
coating, and when the whole number is deposited cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the surface with a roof of hairs, which cannot be too
much admired; for those used for the interior of the
nest are placed without order, but those employed externally
are arranged with as much art and skill as the
tiles of a roof, and as effectually keep out the water, one
layer resting partly on the other, and all having the same
direction, so that the whole resembles a well-brushed
piece of shaggy cloth or fur. When the mother has
finished this labour, which often occupies her for twenty-four
hours, and sometimes even twice that period, her
body, which before was extremely hairy, is almost wholly
naked&mdash;she has stripped herself to supply clothing to her
offspring, and having performed this last duty she expires.
The female moths which thus protect their eggs are often
furnished with an extraordinary quantity of hair about the
anus for this express purpose; and Reaumur conjectures,
that the singular anal patch of scales resembling those of
the wings, but considerably larger, which is found in the
female of <i>Lasiocampa Pityocampa</i>, is destined for the
same purpose<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.</p>

<p>Reaumur had once brought to him a nidus of eggs
clothed still more curiously: they surrounded a twig in
a spiral direction, like those of <i>Lasiocampa Neustria</i>, but
were much more numerous, and were thickly covered with
fine down, not pressed close, but standing off horizontally,
which assumed much the same appearance as a
fox's tail would if twisted spirally round a branch<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>A procedure nearly similar was observed by De Geer
in some species of Aphides (<i>A. Alni</i> and <i>A. Pruni</i>), which
covered their eggs with a white cottony down detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
from their belly by means of their hind legs<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. In this
case, however, the eggs were separately coated with the
down, but there was no general covering to the group.</p>

<p>Several insects make the leaves and other parts of
plants serve as coverings for their eggs. <i>Tenthredo
RosÃ¦</i> L., a saw-fly, and other species of the same genus,
with their saws make an incision in the green twigs of
shrubs and trees, and fill it with a line of eggs placed end
to end, taking care that, as the eggs grow after they are
laid, they are placed at such distances as to leave room
for their expansion<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>. <i>Rhynchites Bacchus</i>, a brilliant
weevil, well known to the vine-dressers for the injury it
does<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>, rolls with much art the leaves of the vine, so as to
form a cavity, in which it places its eggs; other species
practise similar man&#339;uvres; and some probably place
their young progeny in the interior of twigs, making an
opening for that purpose with their rostrum&mdash;at least, I
once saw <i>Rhynchites AlliariÃ¦</i> L. with its rostrum plunged
up to the antennÃ¦ in the twig of a crab-tree. Others of
this tribe, as we know, place their eggs in the interior of
fruits and grain, as the nut, acorn, and common weevils.</p>

<p>It is probable that most of the above coverings serve
another purpose besides the protection of the eggs from
wet and cold&mdash;that of sheltering them from the action of
too great light, which, as Dr. Michellotti by numerous
experiments has ascertained, is fatal to the included
germe<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. On this account it is perhaps that so many insects
fasten their eggs to the under side of leaves. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
exposed in full day have usually an opaque and horny
texture.</p>

<p>Some insects are spared all trouble in providing a
covering for their eggs, their own bodies furnishing one
in every respect adapted to this purpose. Not to mention
the <i>Onisci</i>, or wood-lice, since they rather belong to the
<i>Crustacea</i>, which have a four-valved cell under the breast,
in which they carry their eggs, as the kangaroo does its
young in its abdominal pouch, the whole body of the female
of those strange animals the <i>Cocci</i> becomes a covering
for her eggs, which it incloses on every side. To make
this intelligible to you, further explanation is necessary.
You must have noticed those singular immovable tortoise-shaped
insects, which are such pests to myrtles and other
greenhouse plants. These are the young of a species of
<i>Coccus</i> (<i>C. Hesperidum</i> L.), and <i>their</i> history is that of the
whole race. Part of them never become much bigger than
the size of which you ordinarily see them, and when full-grown
disclose minute two-winged flies, which are the
males. The size of the females, which glue themselves to
a twig or leaf as if lifeless, now augments prodigiously,
and the whole body, distended with the thousands of eggs
which it includes to the bigness of a large pea, without
any vestige of head or limb, resembles a vegetable excrescence
or gall-apple rather than an insect. If you
remove one of them, you will perceive that the under
part of its abdomen is flat and closely applied to the
surface of the branch on which it rests, only a thin
layer of a sort of cotton being interposed between them.
In laying her eggs the female <i>Coccus</i> does not, like most
insects, protrude them beyond her body into day-light;
but as soon as the first egg has passed the orifice of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
oviduct, she pushes it between her belly and the cottony
stratum just mentioned, and the succeeding eggs are deposited
in the same manner until the whole are excluded.
You will ask how there can be found space between the
insect's belly and the cotton, to which at first it was closely
applied, for so large a mass of eggs? To comprehend
this, you must consider that nearly the whole contents of
its abdomen were eggs; that in proportion as these are
extruded a void space is left, which allows the skin of
the under side of the body to be pushed upwards, or
towards that of the back, affording room between it and
the cottony web for their convenient stowage. If you
examine the insect after its eggs are all laid, you will find
that they have merely changed their situation; instead
of being on the upper side of the skin forming the belly,
and within the body, they now are placed between it
(now become concave and nearly touching the back) and
the layer of cotton. As soon as the female <i>Coccus</i> has
finished her singular operation she dies; but her body,
retaining its shape, remains glued upon the eggs, to
which it forms an arched covering, effectually protecting
them, until they are hatched, from every external injury.
Some species lay so many eggs, that the abdomen is not
sufficiently large to cover the whole mass, but merely
one side of it, the remainder being enveloped in cottony
web<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am next to consider the situation of those eggs that
are excluded by the mother in groups <i>without any</i> other
<i>covering</i> than the varnish with which they are usually
besmeared in their passage from the oviduct. The females<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
only place them upon or near the food appropriated
to the young larvÃ¦, to which they adhere by means
of the varnish just mentioned. These groups consist of
a greater or less number; and when the eggs are hatched
by the heat of the sun, the larvÃ¦ begin to disperse and
attack with voracity the food that surrounds them. It
is thus that most butterflies and moths attach their eggs
to the stems, twigs, and leaves of plants; that the lady
birds (<i>CoccinellÃ¦</i>), the aphidivorous flies (<i>Syrphi</i> &amp;c.), and
the lace-winged flies (<i>Hemerobii</i>), deposit them in the
midst of plant-lice (<i>Aphides</i>); that the eggs of some flesh-flies
are gummed upon flesh; those of crickets and grasshoppers
buried in the earth; those of gnats and other
Tipulidans set afloat upon, or submerged in, the water.</p>

<p>Frequently the whole number of eggs laid by one
female is placed in one large group, more commonly,
however, in several smaller ones, either at a distance
from each other on the same plant, or on distinct plants.
The object in the latter case seems to be, in some instances,
to avoid crowding too many guests at one table,
in others to protect the unhatched eggs from the voracity
of the larvÃ¦ first excluded, which would often devour
them if in their immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In the disposition of the eggs which compose these
groups much diversity prevails. Sometimes they are
placed without order in a confused mass: more frequently,
however, they are arranged in different, and
often in very beautiful modes. The common cabbage-butterfly
(<i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>) and many other insects place
theirs upon one end, side by side, so as, comparing
small things with great, to resemble a close column of
soldiers, in consequence of which those larvÃ¦ which, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
hatching, proceed from the upper end, cannot disturb
the adjoining eggs. Many indeed have a conformation
purposely adapted to this position, as the hemisphÃ¦rical
eggs of the puss-moth (<i>Cerura Vinula</i>), which have the
base by which they are gummed membranous and transparent,
while the rest is corneous and opaque. The
same ready exit to the larva is provided for in the oblong
eggs of the emperor moth (<i>Saturnia Pavonia</i>), which
are piled on their sides in two or more lines like bottles
of wine in a bin<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>.</p>

<p>Where the larva does not emerge exactly from the
end of the egg other arrangements take place. The
whirlwig-beetle (<i>Gyrinus natator</i>) and the saw-fly of the
gooseberry &amp;c. (<i>Tenthredo flava</i> L.) dispose theirs end
to end in several rows; the former upon the leaf of some
aquatic grass, the rows being parallel<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, the latter gummed
to the main nerves of gooseberry or currant leaves, the
direction of which they follow<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>But the lackey-moths (<i>Lasiocampa Neustria</i>, <i>castrensis</i>,
&amp;c.) adopt a different procedure. As their eggs,
which are laid in the autumn, are not to be hatched until
the spring, the female does not, like most other moths,
place them upon a leaf, with which they might be blown
by the winter's storms far from their destined food, but
upon the twig of some tree, round which she ranges them
in numerous circles. If you examine your fruit-trees,
you can scarcely fail to find upon the young twigs collections
of these eggs, which are disposed with such admirable
art, that you would take them rather for pearls,
set by the skilful hand of a jeweller, than for the eggs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
an insect. Each of these bracelets, as the French gardeners
aptly call them, is composed of from 200 to 300
pyramidal eggs with flattened tops<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>, having their axes
perpendicular to the circumference of the twig to which
they are fastened, surrounding it in a series of from fifteen
to seventeen close spiral circles, and having their
interstices filled up with a tenacious brown gum, which,
while it secures them alike from the wintry blast and the
attack of voracious insects, serves as a foil to the white
enamel of the eggs that it encompasses. It is not easy
to conceive how these moths contrive to accomplish so
accurately with their tail and hind feet an arrangement
which would require nicety from the hands of an artist;
nor could Reaumur, with all his efforts and by any contrivance,
satisfy himself upon this head. He bred numbers
of the fly from the egg, and supplied the females
after impregnation with appropriate twigs; but these, as
though resolved that imprisonment should not force from
them the secret of their art, laid their eggs at random,
and made no attempt to place them symmetrically<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>This illustrious Entomologist was more successful in
discovering the mode in which another insect, the common
<i>gnat</i>, whose group of eggs is, in some respects, as
extraordinary as that last described, performs its operations.
The eggs of this insect, of a long phial-like form,
are glued together, side by side, to the number of from
250 to 300, into an oblong mass, pointed and more
elevated at each end, so as considerably to resemble a
little boat in shape. You must not here suppose that I
use the term <i>boat</i> by way of illustration merely; for it
has all the essential properties of a boat. In shape it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
pretty accurately resembles a London wherry, being
sharp and higher, to use a nautical phrase, fore and aft;
convex below and concave above; floating, moreover,
constantly on the keel or convex part. But this is not
all. It is besides a <i>life-boat</i>, more buoyant than even
Mr. Greathead's: the most violent agitation of the water
cannot sink it; and what is more extraordinary, and a
property still a desideratum in our life-boats, though
hollow it never becomes filled with water, even though
exposed to the torrents that often accompany a thunder-storm.
To put this to the test, I yesterday (July 25, 1811)
placed half a dozen of these boats upon the surface of a
tumbler half full of water; I then poured upon them a
stream of that element from the mouth of a quart bottle
held a foot above them. Yet after this treatment, which
was so rough as actually to project one out of the glass,
I found them floating as before upon their bottoms, and
not a drop of water within their cavity.</p>

<p>This boat, which floats upon the surface of the water
until the larvÃ¦ are disclosed, is placed there by the female
gnat. But how? Her eggs, as in other insects, are
extruded one by one. They are so small at the base in
proportion to their length that it would be difficult to
make them stand singly upright on a solid surface, much
more on the water. How then does the gnat contrive
to support the first egg perpendicularly until she has
glued another to it&mdash;these two until she has fixed a
third, and so on until a sufficient number is fastened together
to form a base capable of sustaining them in
their perpendicular position? This is her process. She
fixes her four anterior legs upon a piece of leaf, or a
blade of grass, and projects her tail over the water. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
then crosses her two hind legs, and in the inner angle
which they form, retains and supports the first laid egg,
as it proceeds from the anus. In like manner she also
supports the second, third, &amp;c., all of which adhere to
each other by means of their glutinous coating, until she
feels that a sufficient number are united to give a stable
base to her little bark; she then uncrosses her legs, and
merely employs them to retain the mass until it is of the
required size and shape, when she flies away, and leaves
it to its fate floating upon the water<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to mention here a remarkable
circumstance which not seldom attends a kind
of water-scorpion (<i>Naucoris</i> F.) occasionally to be met
with in collections of Chinese insects. Its back is often
covered with a group of rather large eggs, closely arranged;
but whether these are its own eggs or those of
some large species of water-mite (<i>Hydrachna</i> MaÃ¯ll.) has
not been clearly ascertained. On the former supposition,
the ovipositor must be remarkably long and flexile to
enable the animal to place the eggs on its back. In confirmation
of the latter it may be observed, that the species
of the genus <i>Hydrachna</i> usually attach their eggs
to the body and legs of aquatic insects, as for instance
<i>H. abstergens</i> to the water-scorpion (<i>Nepa cinerea</i>), &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>2. After having thus laid before you some of the procedures
of those insects that usually deposit their eggs
in groups, either naked or defended by coverings of various
kinds, I next proceed to a rapid survey of those of
the species that commonly deposit them <i>singly</i>. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of these, as for instance the Admiral Butterfly (<i>Vanessa
Atalanta</i>), glue each egg carefully to its destined leaf by
alighting on it for a moment. Another butterfly (<i>Hipparchia
Hyperanthus</i>) whose caterpillar is polyphagous,
drops hers at random on different plants. In general it
may be observed, that all those larvÃ¦ which live in solitude,
as in the interior of wood, leaves, fruits, grain,
animals, &amp;c., proceed from eggs laid singly by the female,
which is usually provided with an appropriate instrument
for depositing them in their proper situation. Thus the
nut-weevil (<i>Balaninus Nucum</i> Germ.) and also that of the
acorn (<i>B. Glandium</i>) pierce a nut or an acorn with their
long beak, and then deposit in the hole an egg, from
which proceeds the maggot that destroys those fruits.
Leeuwenhoek asserts that the common weevil (<i>Calandra
granaria</i>) adopts the same process, boring a hole in
every single grain of corn before it commits an egg to it,
and at the same time, by this man&#339;uvre, prepares a small
quantity of flour to serve for the food of the tender grub
when it is first hatched<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. It is probable that the Rhyncophorous
or weevil tribe in general chiefly use their beaks
for the purpose of depositing their eggs in different vegetable
substances, and perhaps principally in fruit or grain.
The tribe of gall-flies (<i>Cynips</i>) on the contrary, whose
economy, detailed in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>, interested you so
much, bore an opening for the egg with their spiral oviduct,
which also conveys it.</p>

<p>Another large tribe of insects depositing their eggs
singly, are those which feed upon the bodies of other
animals, into the flesh of which they are either inserted,
or placed so as speedily to find their way into it. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of these introduce them into <i>living</i> animals, and then
leave them to their fate, as the <i>Ichneumons</i> and gad-flies:
others deposit them along with the <i>dead</i> body of an insect
interred in a hole, often prepared with great labour,
as the different species of sand-wasps (<i>SphecidÃ¦</i>), spider-wasps
(<i>PompilidÃ¦</i>), &amp;c.: the manners of the latter of these
tribes have been already adverted to<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>, and those of the
<i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i> will come more fully under consideration
when I treat of the <i>diseases</i> of insects.</p>

<p>A similar labour in providing suitable habitations for
their eggs is undergone by various other insects whose
larvÃ¦ live chiefly on vegetable food, some inserting their
egg within the substance the larva devours, as those that
prey on timber, twigs, roots, or the like, and others on
its surface. One would suppose at first, that the exceedingly
small egg which produces the subcutaneous larvÃ¦
would, by the parent moth, be imbedded in the substance
of the leaf which is to exhibit hereafter their serpentine
galleries: but this is not the case, for she merely glues it
on the outside; at least such was the situation of the only
egg of these very minute moths Reaumur had ever an
opportunity to observe<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p>Other insects, belonging to the tribe which lay their
eggs singly, bury them in the ground. Of this description
are many of the lamellicorn insects, the dung-chafers
(<i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> MacLeay) particularly, which, inclosing
their eggs in a pellet of dung, deposit them in deep cylindrical
cavities. Concerning the proceedings of some
of these, as well as of the whole race of bees, wasps, &amp;c.,
which all lay single eggs, I have before detailed to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
many interesting particulars<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>. I must not conclude this
subject without observing, that the female <i>PycnogonidÃ¦</i>,
an osculant tribe between Insects and <i>Crustacea</i>, carry
their eggs upon two pair of false legs<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>


<p>iii. <i>Substance.</i> From this long dissertation on the <i>situation</i>
of the eggs of insects and matters connected with it,
I pass on to their <i>substance</i> or their external and internal
composition, giving at the same time some account of the
embryo included in them. The eggs of insects, like those
of birds, consist in the first place of an external coat or
shell, varying greatly, as to substance, in different genera.
Most commonly, particularly in those which deposit their
eggs in moist situations, as in dung, earth, and the like,
it is a mere membrane, often thin and transparent, and
showing, as in spiders, all the changes that take place in
the inclosed embryo, as the formation of the head, trunk,
and limbs<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. This membrane is sometimes so delicate
as to yield to the slightest pressure, and insufficient to
protect the included fluids from too rapid an evaporation,
if the eggs be exposed to the full action of the atmosphere.
In most <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and several other tribes, this integument
is considerably stronger, in those moths whose
eggs are exposed throughout the winter, as <i>Lasiocampa
Neustria</i>, &amp;c., so hard as not to yield easily to the knife.
Even in these, however, its substance is more analogous
to horn or a stiff membrane than to the shell of the eggs
of birds. Nothing calcareous enters into its composition,
and it is not perceptibly acted upon by diluted sulphuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
acid. The eggs of birds are lined by a fine membrane;
but I have examined several of those of insects, and
have been able to discover nothing of the kind in them.
I will not, however, affirm that it does not exist, though
the shell of the insect egg appears more analogous to the
membrane that lines that of the bird than to the outside
shell itself.</p>

<p>Within this integument is included a fluid, on the
precise nature of which, except that it is an aqueous
whitish fluid, few or no observations have been made, or
indeed are practicable; but it is reasonable to suppose,
that like the white and yolk of the bird's egg, it serves
for the development of the organs of the germe of the
future insect.</p>

<p>But few observations are recorded that relate to the
embryo included in the egg. It is stated, that it is invested
with an extremely fine and delicate pellicle&mdash;supposed
by some analogous to the <i>Chorion</i> and <i>Amnios</i> of
the human f&#339;tus, though others think the shell of the
egg to correspond with the <i>Chorion</i>, and the successive
integuments of the larva with the <i>Amnios</i><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>. When the
egg is first laid, nothing indeed is to be seen in it but the
fluid just mentioned; the first change in this fluid is the
appearance of the head of the embryo, more particularly
in <i>Coleoptera</i>, of two points, the rudiments of the mandibles,
and of those apertures into the tracheÃ¦ which I
have called spiracles<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>; the little animal we may suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
then assumes its form and limbs. The embryo is usually
so folded in the egg that the head and tail meet<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>, and
the head, annuli, and other parts of the larva are often
visible through the shell<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. Swammerdam even saw the
pulsation of the great dorsal vessel through the shell of
the egg of <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>.</p>

<p>Under this head I must notice another singular circumstance
peculiar I believe to the eggs of insects, that
sometimes, though rarely, they are covered with down or
hair. Those of a singular little hemipterous insect, of a
genus I believe at present undescribed, the ravages of
which upon the larch have been before noticed<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>, are covered
by a downy web, as is the case with the animal
itself. De Geer has described the eggs of a bug, not
uncommon in this country (<i>Pentatoma juniperina</i> Latr.),
which are reticulated with black veins, in which very
short bristles are planted<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>. I possess also a nest of
brown eggs, probably of a species of the same genus,
found upon furze, which appear to be covered with very
short downy hairs. The top of these is flat, and surrounded
by a coronet of short bristles, each surmounted
by a small white ball, so as to wear the appearance of a
beautiful little <i>Mucor</i>. But hairy eggs are not confined
to the Hemiptera Order, for, according to Sepp, those of
the figure-of-eight moth (<i>Bombyx cÃ¦ruleocephala</i>) are of
this description<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.</p>


<p>iv. <i>Number.</i> The fertility of insects far exceeds that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
birds, and is surpassed only by that of fishes<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. But the
number of eggs laid by different species, sometimes even
of the same natural family, is extremely various. Thus
the pupiparous insects may be regarded as producing
only a single egg; <i>Musca Meridiana</i> L., a common fly,
lays two<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>, other flies six or eight; the flea twelve; the
burying beetle (<i>Necrophorus Vespillo</i><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>) thirty; May-flies
(<i>Trichoptera</i> K.) under a hundred; the silk-worm moth
about 500; the great goat-moth(<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) 1,000;
<i>Acarus americanus</i> more than 1,000<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>; the tiger-moth (<i>Callimorpha
Caja</i>) 1,600; some Cocci 2,000, others 4,000;
the female wasp at least 30,000<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>; the queen bee varies
considerably in the number of eggs that she produces in
one season, in some cases it may amount to 40,000 or
50,000 or more<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>; a small hemipterous insect, resembling
a little moth (<i>Aleyrodes proletella</i> Latr.) 200,000. But
all these are left far behind by one of the white ants
(<i>Termes fatale</i> F. <i>bellicosus</i> Smeath.)&mdash;the female of this
insect, as was before observed<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>, extruding from her enormous
matrix not less than 60 eggs in a minute, which
gives 3,600 in an hour, 86,400 in a day, 2,419,200 in a
lunar month, and the enormous number of 211,449,600
in a year: probably she does not always continue laying
at this rate; but if the sum be set as low as possible, it
will exceed that produced by any other known animal in
the creation.</p>


<p>v. <i>Size.</i> The size of the eggs is in proportion to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the insect producing them, though in some instances
small ones produce larger eggs than those laid by bigger
species. Thus the eggs of many <i>Aptera</i>, as those of that
singular mite <i>Uropoda vegetans</i>, and of the bird-louse
found in the golden pheasant, are nearly as large, it is
probable, as the parent insect; while those of the ghost-moth
(<i>Hepialus Humuli</i>) and many other <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
&amp;c. are vastly smaller. This circumstance perhaps depends
principally on the number they produce: the majority
of them, however, are small. The largest egg
known, if it be not rather an egg-case, is that of a spectre
insect (<i>Phasma dilatatum</i>), figured in the Linnean Transactions<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>,
being five lines in length and three in width,
which probably approaches near the size of that of some
humming-birds. The largest egg of any British insect
I ever saw was that of the common black rove-beetle
(<i>Staphylinus olens</i>) sent me by Mr. Sheppard&mdash;this is a
line and half long by a line in width. But we do not often
meet with insect-eggs exceeding a line in length. A vast
number are much smaller: those of EphemerÃ¦ are more
minute than the smallest grains of sand<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>, and some almost
imperceptible, as those of the subcutaneous moths, to the
naked eye. Commonly the eggs laid by one female are
all of the same size; but in several tribes, those containing
the germe of the <i>female</i> are larger than those that
are to give birth to a <i>male</i>. This appears to be the case
with those of the Rhinoceros beetle (<i>Oryctes nasicornis</i><a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>),
and according to Gould with those of ants<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>. As the
female in a vast number of instances is much bigger than
the male, it is not improbable that this law may hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
very extensively. It is stated, however, by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>,
that the reverse of this takes place in the eggs of the
hive-bee, those that are to produce males being larger
than the rest.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity connected with the present head is
the augmentation in bulk which takes place, after exclusion,
in the eggs of the great tribe of saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.), the
gall-flies (<i>Cynips</i> L.), the ants (<i>Formica</i> L.) and the water-mites
(<i>Hydrachna</i> MaÃ¯ll. <i>Atax</i> F.). Those of the two former,
which are usually deposited in the parenchymous substance
of the leaves, or of the young twigs, of various plants,
imbibe nutriment in some unknown manner, through their
membranous skins, from the vegetable juices which surround
them<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>, and when they have attained their full size
are nearly twice as large as when first laid. Except in the
eggs of fishes, whose volume in like manner is said to
augment previously to the extrusion of the young, there
is nothing analogous to this singular fact in any other of
the oviparous tribes of animals, the eggs of which have
always attained their full size when they are laid.</p>

<p>It is to M. P. Huber that we are indebted for the
knowledge of the fact that the eggs of <i>ants</i> grow after
being laid, a circumstance favoured probably by the
moist situation in which the workers are always careful
to keep them. By an accurate admeasurement he found
that those nearly ready to be hatched were almost twice
as big as those just laid<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>. A similar observation was
made on the red eggs of a water-mite (<i>Hydrachna abstergens</i>)
by RÃ¶sel, who conjectured that they draw their
means of increase from the body of the water-scorpions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
(<i>NepÃ¦</i>), of which they form so singular an appendage<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>,
which opinion is confirmed by De Geer, who observes
that when the water-scorpions are covered by an unusual
number of the eggs of the water-mites, they grow weak
and languid, and endeavour to rid themselves of their
parasitic appendages<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. It is most probable that the mite
lately named (<i>Uropoda vegetans</i>), which is often found
planted as it were upon the bodies of various beetles, by
means of a long pedicle, through which, as the f&#339;tus by
an umbilical chord and placenta, it derives its nutriment
from the above animals, is at first so fixed in the egg
state, though before it is disengaged from the pedicle it
is hatched, since it is often found with its legs displayed
and quite active&mdash;this is the more probable, as the eggs
of the water-mite are fixed by a pedicle to the animals to
which they are attached<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>. I have met with a remarkable
instance, in which pedunculated eggs seem to draw nutriment
from the <i>mother</i>, which brings the pedicle still
near to the nature of the umbilical chord. Those of the
small hemipterous insect which infests the larch before
alluded to, are attached to the anal end of the mother by
a short foot-stalk not longer than the egg.</p>

<p>Dr. Derham seems to have observed, that the eggs of
some <i>Diptera</i>, of the tribe of <i>TipulidÃ¦</i>, also increase in
size before the larva is excluded<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>. It seems to me likely
enough, that in this and many of the above cases in which
the egg is supposed to grow, it is rather an extension of
the flexile membrane that forms their exterior proportioned
to the growth of the included embryo from food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
it finds within the egg, than from any absorption from
without.</p>


<p>vi. <i>Shape.</i> We are accustomed to see the eggs of different
species of oviparous animals so nearly resembling
each other in form, that the very term <i>egg-shaped</i> has been
appropriated to a particular figure. Amongst those of
birds, with which we are most familiar, the sole variations
are shades of difference between a globular and oval or
ovate figure. The eggs of insects, however, are confined
by no such limited model. They differ often as much,
both as to their shape, sculpture, and appendages, as one
seed does from another; and it is not improbable that,
if duly studied, they would furnish as good indications
of generic distinctions as GÃ¦rtner has discovered in
those of plants. Their most usual form indeed is globular,
oval, or oblong, with various intermediate modifications.
We meet with them ovate, or of the shape of
the common hen's egg, flat and orbicular, elliptical, conical,
cylindrical, hemispherical, lenticular, pyramidal,
square, turban-shaped, pear-shaped, melon-shaped, boat-shaped,
of the shape of an ale-stand, of a drum, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>,
and sometimes of shapes so strange and peculiar, that
we can scarcely credit their claim to the name of eggs.
Thus the eggs of the gnat are oblong and narrow, or
nearly cylindrical, having at the top a cylindrical knob<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>,
so as to give them the precise form of the round-bottomed
phial sometimes used by chemists: those of the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
water-scorpion (<i>Nepa cinerea</i>) are oblong, and at the
upper end are surrounded by a sort of coronet, consisting
of seven slender rays or bristles of the length of the egg<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>,
so as to resemble somewhat the seeds of <i>Carduus benedictus</i>
(<i>Cnicus acarna</i><a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>) of the old botanists. One would
think this spinous circlet a very awkward appendage to
bodies which are to be gradually extruded through the
fine membranous ovaries and oviduct which inclose them:
but they are so admirably packed, the unarmed end of
each egg fitting closely into the space inclosed by the
spines of the one next below it, or, rather, the spines
which are moveable, embracing it closely, that not only
is no room lost, but the ovaries are perfectly secure from
injury. The eggs of another species of this tribe (<i>Ranatra
linearis</i>) have only two of these spines or bristles&mdash;they
are inserted in the stem of a water-rush (<i>Scirpus</i>)
or other aquatic plant, so as to be quite concealed, and
are only to be detected by the two bristles which stand
out from it<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. The eggs of the beautiful lace-winged flies
(<i>Hemerobius</i>), those golden-eyed insects so serviceable in
destroying the plant-lice (<i>Aphides</i><a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>), are still more singular.
Those of <i>H. Perla</i> are oval, and each of them
attached to a filiform pedicle not thicker than a hair,
and seven or eight times as long as the egg. By this pedicle
(which is supposed to be formed by a glutinous
matter attached to one end, which the female draws out
by abstracting her ovipositor with the egg partly in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
from the leaf, to which she has previously applied it, to
a proper length, when the gluten becoming sufficiently
solid she wholly quits the egg,) the eggs are planted in
groups of ten or twelve on the surface of leaves and twigs,
from which they project like so many small fungi, to some
of which they have a remarkable resemblance. When the
included larva has made its way out of them by forcing
open the top, they look like little vases, and were actually
once figured by a Naturalist, as we learn from Reaumur,
as singular parasitic flowers growing upon the leaves of
the elder, for the origin of which he was extremely puzzled
to account<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>. Eggs similarly furnished with a pedicle
are also laid by other insects; but as most of these have
been before alluded to, it is not necessary to describe them
here<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. The cause of these differences of form is for the
most part concealed from us: in many instances it may
perhaps be referred to that will to vary forms, and so to
glorify his wisdom<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and power, independently of other
considerations, which, as Dr. Paley has well remarked<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>,
seems often to have guided the Great Author of Nature.
But in some cases the end to be answered is sufficiently
evident. The long footstalks of the eggs of the <i>Hemerobius</i>
just mentioned, there can be little doubt, are meant
to place them out of the reach of the hosts of predaceous
insects which roam around them, from whose jaws, thus
elevated on their slender shaft, they are as safe as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
eggs of the tailor bird in its twig-suspended nest from
the attack of snakes. Reaumur has described the eggs
of a kind of fly, common upon the excrements of the
horse and other animals (<i>Scatophaga vulgaris</i> Latr.), or
one related to it, that requires to be immersed in the dung
to which it is committed, on which the future grubs are
to feed. He found that if not thus surrounded with
moisture, they infallibly shrivelled up and came to nothing;
but it is equally necessary that they should not be
wholly covered: if they were, the young larva would be
suffocated at its first exit from the egg. In what way is
this nice point secured? In this manner. Each egg is
provided at its upper end, at which the animal when
hatched comes out, with two diverging horns<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>; these
prevent it from being stuck into the excrement, in which
the female deposits the eggs one by one, more than three-fourths
of its length: and when examined they resemble
not badly, as Reaumur remarks (except that their colour
is white), a parcel of cloves stuck into a pudding, as they
are neatly inserted at due distances in the disgusting
mass<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. The French Naturalists found these eggs in
swine's dung; I have observed them in cow-dung. Latreille
thinks that the bristles above described attached
to the eggs of <i>Nepa</i> and <i>Ranatra</i> have a similar use, as
the female plunges them all but these bristles into the
stems of aquatic plants<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>: but may not this have something
to do with their oxygenation? Reaumur has
figured another egg of a dipterous insect which has a
longitudinal wing or lateral margin attached to it, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
it the form of an oblong square, the object of which, he
conceives, is to give a greater surface by which it may
be more firmly fixed to the substance against which the
fly attaches it<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides these more striking variations in figure, their
surface, though often smooth, is frequently curiously
and most elegantly <i>sculptured</i>, a circumstance that distinguishes
the eggs of no other oviparous animals. Some,
as the margined egg just mentioned, are only sculptured
on one side, the other being plain; or, as those of the
Tusseh silk-worm<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> (<i>Attacus Paphia</i>) and other <i>Bombyces</i>,
which have orbicular depressed eggs with a central cavity
above and below, have their circumference crossed
with wrinkles corresponding with the rings of the inclosed
embryo<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. Others again are sculptured all over. Of
these, in some, the sculpture of the two sides is not symmetrical,
as in those of a fly figured by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>: but
in general there is a correspondence in this respect between
the different parts of the egg. In those elegant
ones before alluded to of some bird-louse attached to the
golden pheasant, the shell resembles the purest wax, and
is scored with longitudinal striÃ¦, each distinguished by
a series of impressed points, which give it a beautiful appearance
of net-work. In the others, as in a common
butterfly (<i>Hipparchia Ãgeria</i>) and moth (<i>Geometra cratÃ¦gata</i>),
the whole surface is covered with hexagonal reticulations<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.
Others, as those of another butterfly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
(<i>Hipparchia Hyperanthus</i>), are beset with minute granules or
tubercles<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. Others again, like those of the cabbage and
hawthorn butterflies (<i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i> and <i>CratÃ¦gi</i>), are
remarkable for beautiful longitudinal ribs, often connected
by elevated lines crossing them at right angles<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>; and in
some, as in another butterfly (<i>Hipparchia Jurtina</i>), crowned
by imbricated scales<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>. Many other minor differences
in this respect might be noticed, but these will suffice to
give some idea of the infinite variety exhibited in this
respect by these little atoms. If the Creator has wrought
them with so much art and skill, can it be beneath his
reasonable creatures to examine and admire them, that
they may glorify those attributes which they serve to illustrate?</p>

<p>Some eggs after exclusion occasionally become slightly
corrugated: Malpighi supposed that this occurs only
when the eggs are barren, having observed that those of
the moth of the silk-worm which preserved their plumpness
always produced caterpillars, while those which lost
their original rotundity and became wrinkled were constantly
unprolific. Bonnet, however, found exactly the
reverse take place in another moth<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>, so that these appearances
are scarcely to be depended upon. Kuhn asserts,
that a virgin female of the puss-moth (<i>Cerura
Vinula</i>) having begun to lay eggs, which were yellow
above, green below, and depressed, he introduced to her
an hour afterwards a male, and some minutes subsequently
to the union, she again deposited eggs, which
were wholly of a dark brown and convex<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>vii. <i>Colour</i>. The colour of the eggs of insects is as various
as their shape and sculpture. They are very often
white, those of some spiders like minute pearls<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>; some
are yellow, as those of the silk-worm; others orange,
such are the eggs of the bloody-nosed beetle (<i>Timarcha
tenebricosa</i>); others again of a golden hue; sometimes
they are of a sanguine red. I remember once being
much surprised at seeing the water at one end of a canal
in my garden as red as blood: upon examining it
further I found it discoloured by an infinite number of
minute red eggs, belonging probably to some dipterous
insect of the Tipulidan tribe. There are also eggs of
every intermediate shade between red and black; some
again are blue and others green. They are not always
of whole colours, for some are speckled like those of
many birds, of which I can show you specimens, that
are also shaped like birds' eggs; these I think were
laid by a common moth (<i>Odenesis potatoria</i>); others are
banded with different colours&mdash;thus the blue eggs of the
lappet-moth (<i>Gastropacha quercifolia</i>) are encircled by
three brown zones<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>; others are brown with a white
zone<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.</p>

<p>Many eggs assume a very different colour after being
laid a few days. In general upon their first exclusion
they are white. Those of the chameleon-fly (<i>Stratyomis
ChamÃ¦leon</i>) which I once found in great numbers, arranged
like tiles on a roof one laid partly over another,
on the under side of the leaves of the water-plantain, from
white become green, and then change to olive green.
Those of the hemipterous enemy of the larch, more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
once mentioned in this letter, are first mouse-coloured,
then they assume a reddish hue, and lastly a blackish
one. Those of the gnat from white in a short time assume
a shade of green, in a few hours they are entirely
green, and at length become gray<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. Those of the silk-worm,
which at first are of a yellow or sulphur colour,
acquire a violet shade. The eggs of that rare moth <i>Endromis
versicolor</i>, are at first sulphur-coloured, then
green, next rose-coloured, and lastly blackish. The
colour of almost all eggs changes when they are near
hatching; but this change depends more frequently upon
the colour of the included larva, which appears through
the transparent shell of the egg, than upon any actual
alteration in the egg itself.</p>


<p>viii. <i>Period of hatching.</i> The general rule for the
hatching of the eggs of insects is the absorption by the
embryo of all the superabundant moisture included in
them; but the time varies according to the state of the
atmosphere, to the action of which they are subjected.
Like those of other animals, they require a certain degree
of heat for the due evolution of the included larva. This
heat in much the greater number of instances is derived
from the temperature of the air, but often also from
other sources. The eggs of the gad-fly tribe are hatched
principally by the heat of the body of the animal to which
they are committed; and doubtless the vital heat of various
larvÃ¦, small as it may be, must contribute something
to the hatching of the eggs deposited in them by
various Ichneumons. In the fermenting bark in which the
instinct of the rhinoceros beetles (<i>Oryctes nasicornis</i> &amp;c.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
impels them to place theirs, the dung which the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>
select for that purpose, and the decaying vegetables
chosen by many other insects, a degree of artificial
heat must exist: and the eggs, or rather egg-like pupÃ¦,
of the spider-fly of the swallow (<i>Ornithomyia Hirundinis</i>)
are hatched by the heat of those birds which sit upon
them along with their own eggs.</p>

<p>Fabricius says, "Insects never sit upon their eggs<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>;"
but certainly, as I formerly related to you<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>, the female
earwig does this, and one would be induced to suppose,
from the circumstance of the young ones following their
mother, as chickens do the hen, that <i>Pentatoma grisea</i>
(<i>Cimex</i> Linn.), formerly mentioned, may do the same<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>.</p>

<p>With these exceptions, the eggs of all insects are
hatched by atmospheric heat alone, the variations in
which determine the more speedy or more tardy disclosure
of the included insect. The eggs of such species as
have several broods in the year, as the nettle butterfly
(<i>Vanessa UrticÃ¦</i>) when laid in summer are hatched in a
few days; but if not laid till the close of autumn, they
remain dormant through the winter, and are only hatched
at the return of spring. That this difference is to be attributed
to the influence of heat has been often proved
by experiment: the autumnal eggs if brought into a
warm room may be hatched as soon as those laid in the
height of summer. Silk-worms' eggs naturally are not
hatched till they have been laid six weeks, but in countries
where they are reared, the women effect their exclusion
in a much shorter period by carrying them in
their bosoms: yet to retard their hatching with particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
views is in many circumstances impossible. When
the heat of the atmosphere has reached a certain point,
the hatching cannot be retarded by cellars; and M.
Faujas has remarked, that in June the silk-worm's eggs
would hatch in an ice-house<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>.</p>

<p>The period of exclusion does not, however, depend
solely upon temperature: the hardness or softness of the
shell, and possibly differences in the consistence of the
included fluid, intended to serve this very purpose, cause
some eggs to be hatched much sooner than others exposed
to the same degree of heat. Thus the eggs of many flesh-flies
are hatched in twenty-four hours<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>; those of bees and
some other insects in three days; those of a common
lady-bird (<i>Coccinella bipunctata</i>) in five or six days;
those of spiders in about three weeks; those of the mole-cricket
in a month; while those of many <i>Lepidoptera</i> and
<i>Coleoptera</i> require a longer period for exclusion. The
hard eggs of <i>Lasiocampa Neustria</i> and <i>castrensis</i>, noticed
above, remain full nine months before being hatched<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>,
as do those of another moth (<i>Hypogymna dispar</i>), which,
though laid in the beginning of the warm month of August,
do not send forth the included caterpillar till the
April following<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>. We know no more of the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
this difference than of that which takes place in the
period of exclusion of the eggs of the different species of
birds.</p>

<p>Some eggs change considerably both their form and
consistence previously to being hatched. M. P. Huber
found that those of different species of ants when newly
laid are cylindrical, opaque, and of a milky white; but just
before hatching their extremities are arched, and they
become transparent with only a single opaque whitish
point, cloud, or zone, in their interior<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>. An analogous
change takes place in the eggs of many spiders, which
just before hatching exhibit a change of form corresponding
with that which the included spider receives
when its parts begin to be developed, the thin and flexible
skin of the egg moulding itself to the body it incloses<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.</p>

<p>In proportion as the germe included in the egg is expanded,
it becomes visible through the shell when transparent:
this is particularly the case with spiders, in
which, as was before observed, every part is very distinctly
seen. At length, when all the parts are consolidated
so as to be capable of motion, which in spiders
takes place in four or five days after they begin to be
visible in the egg, the animal breaks the pellicle by the
swelling of its body and the movement of its legs, and
then quits it, and disengages all its parts one after the
other<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. In general, at least where the shell is harder
than that of spiders, insects make their way out by
gnawing an opening with their mandibles in the part
nearest their head, which, when the shell is very strong
(as in <i>Lasiocampa Neustria</i>, &amp;c.), it is often several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
hours in accomplishing<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. In many instances, however,
the larva is spared this trouble, one end of the egg being
furnished with a little lid or trap-door, which it has but
to force up, and it can then emerge at pleasure: such
lids are to be found in the eggs of several butterflies and
moths, as <i>Satyrus MÃ¦ra</i>, <i>Saturnia pavonia major</i>, &amp;c.
and the common louse<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. In those exquisitely elegant
eggs, before described, of some kind of bird-louse (<i>Nirmus</i>)
found adhering to the base of the neck feathers of
the golden pheasant<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>, there is a lid or cap of this kind
of a hemispherical form terminating in a tortuous style.
Those of a species of bug (<i>Pentatoma</i> Latr.), found by
our friend the Rev. R. Sheppard, besides a convex lid
are furnished with a very curious machine, as it should
seem, for throwing it off. This machine is dark-brown,
of a corneous substance, and of the shape of a cross-bow<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>,
the bow part being attached to the lid or pushing against
it, and the handle, by means of a membrane, to the upper
end of the side of the egg.</p>

<p>When the included animal has made its way out of
the egg, it enters upon a new state of existence, that of
<i>Larva</i>, to which I shall direct your attention in the following
letter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="LETTER_XXX" id="LETTER_XXX">LETTER XXX.</a></h2>

<h3><i>STATES OF INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>LARVA STATE.</h5>


<p>The <i>Larva</i> state is that in which insects exist immediately
after their exclusion from the egg (or from the
mother in ovo-viviparous species), in which they usually
eat voraciously, change their skin several times, and have
the power of locomotion, but do not propagate.</p>

<p>Almost all larvÃ¦, at their birth, are for a time in a very
feeble and languid state, the duration of which differs in
different species. In most it continues for a very short
time, a few minutes or perhaps hours, after which they
revive and betake themselves to their appropriate food.
In others, as in the generality of spiders, this debility
lasts for seven or eight days, and in some species even a
month, during which the young ones remain inactive in
the egg-pouch<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>, and it is not till they have cast their first
skin that their active state of existence commences.</p>

<p>All larvÃ¦ may be divided into two great divisions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="text-indent:-1em">I. Those which in general form more or less resemble
the perfect insect.</p>

<p style="text-indent:-1em">II. Those which are wholly unlike the perfect insect.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>I shall begin by calling your attention to the characters
of the <i>first</i> of these divisions: the second, which is
by far the most numerous, will be afterwards considered.</p>


<p>I. The <i>first</i> division includes the larvÃ¦ of <i>Scorpions</i>,
<i>Spiders</i>, <i>Cockroaches</i>, <i>Grasshoppers</i>, <i>Lanthorn-flies</i>, <i>Bugs</i>,
&amp;c.; or generally, with the exception of the <i>Flea</i> and
<i>Crustacea</i>, the whole of the <i>Linnean</i> Orders <i>Aptera</i> and
<i>Hemiptera</i>. All these larvÃ¦, however remotely allied in
other respects, agree in the general similarity which they
bear to the perfect insects which proceed from them.
The most acute entomologist, untaught by experience,
could not even guess what would be the form of the
perfect insects to be produced from larvÃ¦ of the <i>second</i>
division, while they can recognise the form of the spider,
the cricket, the cockroach, the bug, and the frog-hopper,
in that of the larvÃ¦. There are, however, differences in
the degrees of this resemblance, according to which we
may, perhaps, divide this tribe in their second state as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="text-indent:-1em">i. Those that resemble the perfect insect, except in
the relative proportions and number of some
of their parts.</p>

<p style="text-indent:-1em">ii. Those which resemble the perfect insect, except
that they are apterous, or not yet furnished
with organs of flight.</p></blockquote>

<p>i. Spiders, <i>Phalangia</i>, scorpions, lice, <i>PodurÃ¦</i>, sugar-lice
(<i>Lepisma</i>), mites, centipedes, millepedes, &amp;c. come
under the <i>first</i> subdivision. The larvÃ¦ of the first six
tribes here mentioned differ at their birth from the perfect
insect, only in size and the proportions of their parts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Thus the larvÃ¦ of spiders have their legs of a different
relative length from that which they subsequently acquire;
and the palpi in the males, which previously to
the discoveries of Treviranus were regarded as their
sexual organs, are not yet fully developed<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>: and a similar
difference takes place in the legs of <i>Phalangia</i>.
The general form too of the body undergoes slight alterations,
and the colour very considerable ones, with each
change of the skin&mdash;a change to which all these tribes
are subject.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ of the three last-mentioned tribes (the
mites, centipedes, and millepedes) differ from the perfect
insect not only in the proportion but also in the
number of their parts. Leeuwenhoeck states (and De
Geer confirms his assertion, extending it to other species
of mites<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>), that the common cheese-mite, which in its
perfect state has <i>eight</i> legs, when first excluded from the
egg has but <i>six</i>, the third pair being wanting<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. Some
however are born with <i>eight</i> legs, for instance <i>A. eruditus</i>
of Schrank, which he saw come from the egg itself with
that number<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>. Others again have never more than six
legs: this is the case with Latreille's genera&mdash;<i>Caris</i>,
<i>Leptus</i>, <i>Atoma</i>, and <i>Ocypetes</i> of Dr. Leach<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. In the
centipedes (<i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i>) and millepedes (<i>IulidÃ¦</i>) differences
still more remarkable, as I have stated in a former
letter, have been observed by De Geer; these animals,
in their progress to the perfect state, not only gain
several additional pairs of <i>legs</i>, but also several additional
<i>segments</i> of the body. This illustrious Entomologist found
that <i>Pollyxenus lagurus</i> (<i>Scolopendra</i> L.) was born a hexapod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
with but three segments and as many pairs of feet,
but successively acquired five additional segments with
other appendages, and nine more pairs of feet<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>. A species
of millepede (<i>Iulus terrestris</i> L.), which he also
traced from its birth, and which begins the world at first
with only eight segments and six feet, by a successive
development at length acquires, in its perfect state, 50
segments and not less than 200 feet<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>. The nature of
these very singular accretions, which Latreille and Mr.
Wm. MacLeay have also observed in the centipedes<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>,
seems not well understood. If, as is most probable,
though De Geer could not find any exuviÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>, the larvÃ¦
cast a skin before each change, they do not essentially
differ from the metamorphosis of other insects. The
legs that these insects thus acquire are affixed to the
abdomen, the six that they set out with being attached
to the part representing the trunk, so that the former
may be regarded as analogous to the prolegs of caterpillars.
These animals therefore, as I have before intimated,
invert the order of Nature, and from <i>perfect</i> degenerate
into <i>imperfect</i> insects.</p>

<p>ii. If you examine the <i>cockroach</i>, <i>cricket</i>, or <i>grasshopper</i>,
in different stages of their growth, you will find that
the larva does not vary essentially from the perfect insect,
except in wanting wings and elytra. The case is the
same in almost all the Linnean genera of the modern
order&mdash;<i>Hemiptera</i>; and with <i>Raphidia</i>, <i>Termes</i>, and
<i>Psocus</i>, in the <i>Neuroptera</i>. Some of these, however, exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
slighter discrepancies in the proportion of some of
their parts, but without affecting the general resemblance.
Thus the larvÃ¦ of the common ear-wig have at first only
<i>eight</i>, and subsequently <i>nine</i> joints to their antennÃ¦,
whereas the perfect insect has <i>fourteen</i><a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>; and the forceps
is quite different, resembling rather two straight styles
than what its name implies. In those also of many bugs
(<i>Coreus marginatus</i> F. &amp;c.), the joints of the antennÃ¦ are
of a shape dissimilar to that which obtains in the perfect
insect. In that of the common water-scorpion, the anal
air-tube, which is so long in the imago, is scarcely visible<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.
In the <i>Cicada</i> tribe, so celebrated for their song<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>,
neither the larva nor the imago have the enormous thigh
armed below with strong teeth, the tibiÃ¦ terminating in
a fixed incurved claw, probably for the purpose of digging
the holes into which they retire till they disclose the
fly, which distinguish the pupÃ¦ of some species, and is
particularly conspicuous in one commonly brought from
China<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>. These often exhibit also other minor differences.</p>


<p>II. In treating of the second great division of larvÃ¦,
those that are wholly unlike the parent insect,&mdash;which
includes, with few exceptions<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>, the whole of the Linnean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
orders, <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>,
the majority of the <i>Neuroptera</i>, <i>Coccus</i> and <i>Aleyrodes</i> in
<i>Hemiptera</i>, and the genus <i>Pulex</i> in <i>Aptera</i>,&mdash;I shall advert
to their characters, under several distinct heads; and
to avoid unnecessary circumlocution, I shall in what follows
wholly leave out of consideration the <i>first</i> division
already explained, and use the term <i>larvÃ¦</i> with reference
only to those of the <i>second</i>. The heads under which I
propose to treat of them are: The <i>substance</i> of their body,
its <i>parts</i>, <i>shape</i>, or figure, <i>clothing</i>, <i>colour</i>. Also the
<i>Economy</i> or mode of life of these creatures: their <i>food</i>,
<i>moultings</i>, <i>growth</i>, <i>age</i>, <i>sex</i>, and their preparations for assuming
the <i>PupÃ¦</i>.</p>


<p>i. <i>Substance</i>, with the exception of the head and six
fore-feet, which are usually corneous, the exterior integument
or skin of larvÃ¦ is commonly of a membranous
texture, and the body is of a much softer consistence
than in the perfect insect. In those, however, of some
<i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i> and other <i>Coleoptera</i>, the dorsal part of
the three first pieces, which represent the trunk of the
perfect insect, is hard and horny. Some also have their
whole skin coriaceous, as the tortoise-shell butterfly
(<i>Vanessa polychloros</i>); and some few, as the wire-worm
(<i>Elater segetum</i>), and other <i>Elateres</i>, very hard. I possess
a very remarkable larva from Brazil, from the extreme
flatness of its body, and from its having cavities to
receive its legs when unemployed, probably living under
bark, the skin of which is still harder than that of the
grub of the Elaters. Perhaps it has to resist great
pressure; and on that account is gifted with this quality,
so seldom to be met with in other kinds of larvÃ¦. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
interior of the body of these animals is generally of a
softer consistence than in the perfect insect. Their intestines,
and other internal organs, are usually wrapped
in a voluminous substance of a fatty nature, which is regarded
as analogous to the <i>epiploon</i>, <i>omentum</i>, or <i>caul</i>,
which envelops the viscera of quadrupeds, &amp;c., and is
called by Reaumur the <i>corps graisseux</i>. The use of this
general flexibility of larvÃ¦ is obvious; for, their bodies
being mostly long and narrow, a hard rigid covering
would have been very inconvenient, and a considerable
impediment to their motions. When a caterpillar is
feeding, it has occasion to apply its body to any part of
the margin of a leaf so as to support itself by its prolegs,
and when moving it wants to give it all the curves that
are necessary to enable it to avoid obstacles, and thread
its way through the sinuous labyrinths which it must
often traverse. On the other hand, the hardness of the
substance of its head affords a strong fulcrum to the
muscles which keep its powerful jaws in constant play.
The larvÃ¦, indeed, of some <i>Diptera</i> have a membranous
head; but their mandibles, which serve also as
legs, are not grinders, but merely claws, the muscles of
which require less powerful support<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>. Under this head
it may be proper to observe, that generally larvÃ¦ are
opaque; but some, as those of ants, and a few <i>Lepidoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>,
are diaphanous. That of <i>Corethra crystallina</i>
(<i>Tipula</i> De Geer) is so beautifully transparent as to resemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a piece of crystal, and scarcely to be distinguished
from the water in which it lives<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>.</p>


<p>ii. <i>Parts.</i> The body of each larva consists of the <i>head</i>,
including its different organs, and of the <i>succeeding segments</i>,
of which the three first may usually be denominated
the <i>trunk</i>, and have the six anterior feet, when
present, attached to their under side: the remainder is
the <i>abdomen</i>. The latter includes in some species a variable
number of membranous feet, as well as various appendages
affixed usually to its tail and sides. No larva
is ever furnished with wings<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>. Each of these greater
divisions, and the organs which they include, require
separate consideration.</p>

<p>1. <i>Head.</i> This, as was lately observed, is exteriorly of
a horny substance, or at least harder than the rest of the
body, in most larvÃ¦; and on this account, though rarely
separated from it by any visible distinct neck<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, is, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
larva be of a tolerable size, distinguished at the first view.
In those of many Dipterous insects, however, the head is
covered with the same flexible membranous skin with the
rest of the body, from which it is often scarcely to be distinguished.
In these, except that it contains the organs
of manducation, it wears no more the appearance of a
head than any other segment of the body, and scarcely
so much as the last or anal one. The head of these larvÃ¦
is also remarkable for another peculiarity,&mdash;that it is capable
of being extended or contracted, and assuming different
forms at the will of the insect: a property which
the head of no superior animal can boast. It is probable
that there is a considerable variety in the shape and circumstances
of the heads of larvÃ¦; but since, with the exception
of those of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, they have had less attention
paid to them than they deserve (indeed in a vast
number of cases, from the difficulty of meeting with them,
these variations, except in a few instances, have not been
described), I will here mention a few of the most remarkable.
The head of the young larva at its first exclusion
from the egg is usually the most dilated part of the body,
but it does not often continue so. In that of <i>Cicindela
campestris</i>, however,&mdash;the beautiful green beetle sometimes
found in sandy banks,&mdash;and also in several caterpillars
of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, it is much larger than any of the
following segments<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>, which, in conjunction with the
animal's formidable jaws, gives it a most ferocious appearance.
In some lepidopterous larvÃ¦ the head is of
the same diameter with the rest of the body, but in insects
in general it may, I think, be stated as less; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
occasionally it bears no proportion whatever to it. This
is the case with the subcortical one from Brazil lately
mentioned. It is more commonly longer than broad;
but in some, as in the larvÃ¦ of carrion beetles (<i>SilphÃ¦</i>),
the reverse of this takes place. Its shape varies from
triangular to orbicular, the mouth of the animal forming
the vertex of the triangle. In some larvÃ¦ of <i>Hemerobii</i>,
however, the head is narrowest behind. That of the grub
of a gnat noticed above (<i>Corethra crystallina</i>) forms a
kind of sharp horn or claw, terminating the body anteriorly<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.
The contour of the head of larvÃ¦ is usually
intire and unbroken; but in the caterpillars of some <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
as the butterfly called the grand admiral (<i>Vanessa
Atalanta</i>), the Glanville fritillary (<i>MelitÃ¦a Cinxia</i>), &amp;c.
it is divided into two lobes<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>. In the Brazil flat larvÃ¦ it
is trilobed, each lateral lobe being divided into three
smaller ones: in which circumstance it somewhat resembles
the head of some subcortical <i>CimicidÃ¦</i>. Although
the part we are treating of is generally without <i>horns</i>,
yet in some tropical butterflies of the tribe of <i>Nymphales</i>,
it is singularly armed with them. Thus <i>Papilio Anchises</i>
is distinguished, according to Madame Merian<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>, by two
in the occiput, which it has the power of retracting. In
the purple highflier (<i>Apatura Iris</i>), a British species, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
two lobes of the head, I am informed, terminate behind in
two horns; as they do likewise in the brilliant <i>Morpho
Menelaus</i><a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>, the lobes assuming the form of a pear, and
the horn representing the stalk. In a caterpillar I found
amongst Mr. Francillon's larvÃ¦, the head is bilobed,
with a very long recurving subcapitate subramose spine.
In <i>Satyrus CassiÃ¦</i>, the head is armed with three occipital
stout spines<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. The larva of <i>Nymphalis Amphinome</i> Latr.
(<i>Limenitis</i> F.) is crowned with a coronet of eight occipital
stout acute spines, the intermediate ones being the
longest<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>; and that of <i>Morpho Teucer</i> has a similar coronet,
consisting of only seven blunt <i>rays</i>, seemingly, rather
than spines<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. With regard to the articulation of the
head with the trunk, it is generally by its <i>whole</i> diameter;
but in some instances, only by a <i>part</i> of it. This is
the case with one of a sphinx figured by Mad. Merian<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>;
and I have another, probably belonging to the nocturnal
<i>Lepidoptera</i> (<i>PhalÃ¦na</i> L.)<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>. In both these, the head is
vertical and triangular; and in the latter (which is a remarkable
creature, the tail itself being more like a head,
and furnished with what resemble two prominent black
eyes) the vertex of the triangle is considerably higher than
the back of the animal. Whatever may be the clothing of
the body, the head is usually <i>naked</i>. Sometimes, however,
it is itself beset with very small simple spines, as in the butterfly
of the mallow (<i>Hesperia MalvÃ¦</i>); or with longer
compound ones, such as are found on the rest of the body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
This is the case with one of a butterfly named by RÃ¶sel
<i>Papilio morsa</i>. The most common <i>colour</i> of the head of
larvÃ¦, where it differs from the rest of the body, is a
darker or lighter reddish brown, or piceous. This is
particularly observable in those of Coleopterous insects,
but it is very commonly in other tribes of the same hue.
Sometimes, amongst the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the head is of a
different colour from the rest of the body; especially
where a contrast renders it striking. I can show the caterpillar
of some insect, probably of the hawk-moth tribe
(<i>SphingidÃ¦</i>), from Georgia, remarkable for the length of
its anal spine, in which the body is black, and the head
red: another has a white head and a brown body. In
the larvÃ¦ of some <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Coleoptera</i>, and <i>Diptera</i>,
the head can be wholly or nearly withdrawn within the
first segment of the body. This may be readily seen in
that of the common glow-worm; and that of a small gnat
(<i>Tipula replicata</i> De Geer) withdraws it so completely
that the anterior margin of that segment closes the orifice,
so that the animal appears to have no head<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.&mdash;The
parts of the head which require distinct consideration
are, the <i>eyes</i>, <i>antennÃ¦</i>, and the <i>mouth</i>: consisting
of various organs, which will be specified. Some of these
parts and organs are peculiar to larvÃ¦ of one order,
others to those of another, and some are furnished with
them all.</p>


<p><i>Eyes.</i> The larvÃ¦ of many insects have no eyes. Those
with antennÃ¦ which terminate in a lamellated clava
(<i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> L.), and capricorn beetles also (<i>Cerambyx</i> L.),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
amongst the <i>Coleoptera</i>, are without them, and probably
several others; and amongst the <i>Diptera</i>, all those with
a membranous or variable head. Those of the remaining
orders, with the exception, perhaps, of some <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Lepidoptera</i>, are furnished with these organs;
and in the <i>Coleoptera</i> all the predaceous tribes, as well
as most of those that are herbivorous or granivorous,
and the Gnats and other Tipulidans (<i>TipulariÃ¦</i> Latr.) in
the <i>Diptera</i>, are also distinguished by them. In the larvÃ¦
of the dragon-flies (<i>Libellula</i> L.), and other <i>Neuroptera</i>,
they are composed of many facets as in those of
the perfect insect, from which they differ chiefly in being
smaller. But in the other insects of this description they
are simple, and resemble those of the <i>Arachnida</i>, and
many aptera. These simple eyes vary in their number,
in different genera and tribes, from one to six on each
side of the head. Thus the larva of <i>Telephorus</i>, and the
saw-flies, has only <i>one</i><a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>; that of <i>Cicindela three</i>, the two
posterior ones being large with a red pupil surrounded
by a paler iris, which adds to the fierce aspect of this
animal; and the anterior one very minute. Those
of the tortoise-beetles also (<i>Cassida</i>) have <i>three</i><a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>; of
<i>Staphylinus, four</i>; of <i>Timarcha</i> (the bloody-nosed beetle)
<i>five</i>; of <i>Carabus</i>, and the <i>Lepidoptera</i> in general, <i>six</i>.
In the last they are of different sizes, and generally arranged
in a circle: in that of <i>Hemerobius</i> there are five in
a circle, with one central one<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. The appearance of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
globules, which are often not visible but under a powerful
lens, is so different from that of the eyes of a butterfly
or moth, or other perfect insect, that it has been
doubted whether they actually perform the office of <i>eyes</i>,
but without reason. They occupy the usual station of those
organs, being situated in many instances upon a protuberance
which appears to incase them; and seem of a construction
closely analogous to that of the eyes of spiders,
and the <i>stemmata</i> or <i>ocelli</i> of <i>Hymenoptera</i>, which have
been satisfactorily proved to be organs of vision. In the
larva of a moth not yet ascertained to exist in this country,
<i>Attacus Tau</i>, and probably other species, the eyes,
after the skin has been changed a few times, are no longer
to be seen<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.</p>

<p><i>AntennÃ¦.</i> Most larvÃ¦ are provided with organs near
the base of the mandibles, which from their situation and
figure may be regarded as antennÃ¦. Fabricius has asserted
that the larvÃ¦ of the saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.) have
no antennÃ¦; but in this he was mistaken, for though
very short, they are discoverable in them, as he might
have learned by consulting De Geer<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. In the majority
of <i>Neuropterous</i> larvÃ¦, they almost precisely resemble
those of the perfect insect. In all the rest they are very
different. The antennÃ¦ of Coleopterous larvÃ¦ are usually
either filiform or setaceous, consisting of four or five
joints, nearly equal in length. Those of Lepidopterous
larvÃ¦ are commonly conical, as are those likewise of
<i>Chrysomela</i> and <i>Coccinella</i> &amp;c. amongst the <i>Coleoptera</i>,
and very short, composed of two or three joints, of which
the last is much thinner than the first, and ends in one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
two hairs or bristles. These antennÃ¦ the larva has the
power of protruding or retracting at pleasure. Lyonnet
informs us, that the caterpillar of the great goat-moth
(<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) can draw the joints of its antennÃ¦ one
within the other, so as nearly to conceal the whole<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>.
The larva of the common gnat has two long incurved setaceous
antennÃ¦, fringed with hairs at some distance from
their apex, which consist only of a single joint<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>. The
greater number of Dipterous larvÃ¦, however, all indeed
except the Tipulidans (<i>TipulariÃ¦</i> Latr.), and many belonging
to the <i>Coleoptera</i> and <i>Hymenoptera</i> orders (as
those of <i>Curculio</i>, <i>Apion</i>, <i>Apis</i>, &amp;c.), are wholly deprived
of antennÃ¦. It is a general rule, that the antennÃ¦ of
larvÃ¦ are shorter than the same organs in the perfect insect,
the tribe <i>Ephemerina</i> perhaps affording the only
example in which the reverse of this takes place<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i> All larvÃ¦ have a mouth situated in the head,
by which they receive their food, and furnished with one
or more instruments for the purpose of mastication and
deglutition. These instruments, in all the orders except
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, some <i>Neuroptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>, bear a general
resemblance to the same parts in the perfect insect.
In larvÃ¦ of the Coleopterous, Lepidopterous, and Hymenopterous
orders, we can distinguish for the most part
an upper and under lip; two pairs of jaws answering to
the mandibulÃ¦ and maxillÃ¦; and two, four, or six palpi<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>:
and some of these instruments may be found in
most <i>Diptera</i>. Each of these parts require separate notice.</p>

<p><i>Upper-lip</i> (<span class="smcap">Labrum</span>). The mouth of almost all larvÃ¦,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
except some of the order <i>Diptera</i>, are provided with a
distinct <i>upper-lip</i>, for retaining their food during mastication.
As the construction of this part does not widely
differ from that of the perfect insect, which will hereafter
be more fully described, it is only necessary to observe,
that it is usually a transverse moveable plate, attached
posteriorly to the nasus (<i>clypeus</i> F.), and situated just
above the mandibles<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Upper-jaws</i> (<span class="smcap">MandibulÃ¦</span>). The most usual figure of
these, which are of a hard horny consistence<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>, is that of
two slightly concave, oblong, or triangular plates, often
at their lower extremity of considerable thickness, and of
very irregular form, the base of which is filled with
powerful muscles, and planted in the side of the mouth
so as to move transversely. The other extremity can be
made to meet or diverge like the claws of pincers, and
are divided into one or more tooth-like indentations, by
means of which the food of the larva is cut<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>. This is
their construction in the larvÃ¦ of all <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and in
many of those of the other orders. They frequently,
however, assume a different form, though their situation
is always the same. Thus in the larvÃ¦ of the capricorn
beetles (<i>Cerambyx</i> L.) and of other wood-boring species,
they are shaped like the half of a cone, the inner sides of
which, applying close to each other, form a pair of powerful
grindstones, capable of comminuting the hardest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
timber<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>. M. Cuvier has observed, with regard to the mandibulÃ¦
of those of stag-beetles (<i>Lucanus</i>), that besides
their teeth at the extremity, they have towards their base
a flat striated molary surface; so that they both cut and
grind their ligneous food<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. It seems to have escaped
him, that a similar structure takes place in many perfect
insects of the lamellicorn tribe, as I shall hereafter show
you. In the larvÃ¦ of the water-beetles (<i>Dytiscus</i> L.),
ant-lions (<i>Myrmeleon</i> L.), and lace-winged flies (<i>Hemerobius</i>
L.), they resemble somewhat the forceps at the tail
of an ear-wig, being long and incurved; and, what is more
remarkable, hollow and perforated at the end, so as to
serve as a channel for conveying into the larva's mouth
the juices of the prey which by their aid it has seized.
Reaumur even asserts, that the larva of <i>Myrmeleon</i> has
no other entrance into its throat than through these tubular
mandibles<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. That of the rove-beetles (<i>Staphylinus</i>
L.), and of many other Coleopterous genera, have
these organs of this forcipate construction, without being
perforated<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>. In the larva of the carnivorous flies, and
many other <i>Diptera</i>, are two black incurved subulate
parts, connected at the base, and capable of being protruded
out of, and retracted into, the head, through the
skin of which they are usually visible. As I informed
you in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>, these mandibles are used for
<i>walking</i> as well as <i>feeding</i>: they are parallel to each
other, and are neither formed for cutting nor grinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
like the mandibles of other insects, but merely detach
particles of food by digging into it and tearing the fibres
asunder. In this operation they are probably assisted by
an acutely triangular dart-like instrument of a horny substance,
which in some species (<i>Musca vomitoria</i>) is
placed between the two. In others this part is wanting.
Some Dipterous larvÃ¦ have two similar mandibles, but instead
of being parallel, they are placed one above the other;
others (<i>Musca domestica</i> and <i>meridiana</i>) have but one such
mandible, and some have no perceptible mandible of any
kind. The mandibles of the larva of the crane-flies (<i>Tipula</i>),
which are transverse and unguiform, do not act against
each other, but against two other fixed, internally concave
and externally convex, and dentated pieces<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Under-jaws</i> (<span class="smcap">MaxillÃ¦</span>). These are a pair of organs,
usually of a softer consistence, placed immediately under
the upper-jaws; but as they are usually so formed and situated
as not to have any action upon each other, it is
probable that in general they rather assist in submitting
the food to the action of the mandibulÃ¦, than in the comminution
of it. In Lepidopterous larvÃ¦ they appear to
be conical or cylindrical (at least in that of the cossus
so admirably figured by Lyonnet<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>), and to consist of two
joints; which may, I imagine, be analogous to the upper
and lower portions of which the maxillÃ¦ of perfect insects
usually consist. The last of these joints is surmounted
by two smaller jointed palpiform organs. If any part of
the maxillÃ¦ can act upon each other, it is these organs
or palpi; but it is evident they are not calculated for mastication,
although they may assist in the retention of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
substance to be masticated. In a figure given by Reaumur
of the under side of the head of another lepidopterous
larva (<i>Erminea Pomonella</i>), the maxillÃ¦ consist of
a single joint, and appear to be crowned by chelate palpi<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>:
a circumstance which is also observable in that of a
common species of stag-beetle (<i>Lucanus parallelipipedus</i>),
the weevil of the water-hemlock (<i>Lixus paraplecticus</i><a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>),
and other insects. In general the maxillÃ¦ of larvÃ¦ are
without the lobe or lobes discoverable in those of most
perfect insects, this part being usually represented by a
kind of nipple, or palpiform jointed process, strictly analogous
to the interior maxillary palpi of the predaceous
coleoptera; but in most of the lamellicorn beetles the
lobe exists in its proper form<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, as it does likewise in that
of the capricorn-beetle before noticed (<i>Callidium violaceum</i><a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>).
In the former instance, it is armed with spines or
claws; but in the latter it is unarmed, and rounded at the
end. In the larva of <i>Cicindela campestris</i>, the base of the
maxilla runs in a transverse direction from the mentum,
to which, as is usually the case, it is attached. From this
at right angles proceeds the lobe, from the outer side of
which the feeler emerges; and the inner part terminates
in an unguiform joint, ending in two or three bristles.
The structure in the larvÃ¦ of water-beetles (<i>Dytiscus</i> L.)
is different, for they appear to be without maxillÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>; but
the case really seems to be, that these organs are represented
by the first joint of what M. Cuvier calls their
<i>palpi</i><a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>; from which proceed the real palpi, the interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
one being very short, and consisting only of a single
joint. These maxillÃ¦ of larvÃ¦ were regarded by Reaumur
and other writers as parts of the under-lip, on each
side of which they are situated; and indeed, as well as
those in the perfect insect, they form a part of the same
machine, being connected by their base with the mentum,
which is part of the labium, but they are clearly analogous
to the maxillÃ¦ of the imago. They are not to be
found in the larvÃ¦ of many Dipterous insects, and perhaps
in some species belonging to other orders. In some
Neuropterous larvÃ¦, as those of the <i>Libellulina</i> MacLeay,
the maxillÃ¦ are of a substance quite as solid and horny as
the mandibles, which in every respect they resemble<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Under-lip</i> (<span class="smcap">Labium</span>). Between the two maxillÃ¦ in the
larvÃ¦ of most of the insects under consideration is a part
termed by Reaumur the middle division of the under-lip,
but which is in fact analogous to the whole of that organ
in the <i>imago</i>. This organ varies in shape, being sometimes
quadrangular, often conical, &amp;c. Interiorly it is
frequently connected with a more fleshy protuberance,
called the tongue by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>, and supplying the place
of the <i>ligula</i> in the perfect insect. On each side of the
apex of the under-lip is a minute feeler, and in the middle
between these in the <i>Lepidoptera</i> and many others, is
a filiform organ, which I shall call the <i>spinneret</i> (<i>Fusulus</i>),
through which the larva draws the silken thread employed
in fabricating its cocoon, preparatory to assuming
the pupa state, and for other purposes<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>. This organ is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
found only in those larvÃ¦ which have the power of spinning
silk; that is, in all <i>Lepidoptera</i>, most <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
<i>Trichoptera</i>, some <i>Neuroptera</i>, and even a <i>Dipterous</i> insect<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.
This tube, Lyonnet had reason to believe, is composed
of longitudinal slips, alternately corneous and membranous,
so as to give the insect the power of contracting
its diameter, and thus making the thread thicker or
smaller. There is only a single orifice at the end, which
is cut obliquely, somewhat like a pen, only with less obliquity,
and without a point, the opening being below, so
as to be conveniently applicable to the bodies on which
the larva is placed. Reaumur conceived that this spinneret
had two orifices; but Lyonnet ascertained this to
be a mistake, the two silk tubes uniting into one before
they reach the orifice. From the contractile nature of
the sides and the form of the orifice, combined with the
power the insect has of moving it in every direction, results
the great difference which we see in the breadth and
form of the threads, some being seven or eight times as
thick as others, some cylindrical, others flat, others channelled,
and others of different thickness in different parts<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.
In the larvÃ¦ of many <i>Diptera</i> the under-lip is merely a
small tubercle, which can be protruded from the insect's
mouth by pressure<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable prepensile instruments, in
which the art and skill of a <span class="smcap">Divine Mechanician</span> are
singularly conspicuous, and which appears to be without
a parallel in the insect world, may be seen in the under-lip
of the various species of dragon-fly (<i>Libellula</i> L.). In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
other larvÃ¦ this part is usually small and inconspicuous,
and serves merely for retaining the food and assisting in
its deglutition; but in these it is by far the largest organ
of the mouth, which when closed it entirely conceals;
and it not only retains but actually seizes the animal's
prey, by means of a very singular pair of jaws with which
it is furnished. Conceive your under-lip (to have recourse,
as Reaumur on another occasion<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>, to such comparison,)
to be horny instead of fleshy, and to be elongated
perpendicularly downwards<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>, so as to wrap over
your chin and extend to its bottom,&mdash;that this elongation
is there expanded into a triangular convex plate<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>, attached
to it by a joint<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>, so as to bend upwards again and
fold over the face as high as the nose, concealing not
only the chin and the first-mentioned elongation, but the
mouth and part of the cheeks<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>: conceive, moreover, that
to the end of this last-mentioned plate are fixed two other
convex ones, so broad as to cover the whole nose and
temples<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>,&mdash;that these can open at pleasure, transversely
like a pair of jaws, so as to expose the nose and mouth,
and that their inner edges where they meet are cut into
numerous sharp teeth or spines, or armed with one or
more long and sharp claws<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>:&mdash;you will then have as accurate
an idea as my powers of description can give, of
the strange conformation of the under-lip in the larvÃ¦ of
the tribes of <i>Libellulina</i>; which conceals the mouth and
face precisely as I have supposed a similar construction
of your lip would do yours. You will probably admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
that your own visage would present an appearance not very
engaging while concealed by such a mask; but it would
strike still more awe into the spectators, were they to see
you first open the two upper jaw-like plates, which would
project from each temple like the blinders of a horse;
and next, having by means of the joint at your chin let
down the whole apparatus and uncovered your face, employ
them in seizing any food that presented itself, and
conveying it to your mouth. Yet this procedure is that
adopted by the larvÃ¦ provided with this strange organ.
While it is at rest, it applies close to and covers the face.
When the insects would make use of it, they unfold it
like an arm, catch the prey at which they aim by means
of the mandibuliform plates, and then partly refold it so
as to hold the prey to the mouth in a convenient position
for the operation of the two pairs of jaws with which they
are provided. Reaumur once found one of them thus
holding and devouring a large tadpole;&mdash;a sufficient proof
that Swammerdam was greatly deceived in imagining
earth to be the food of animals so tremendously armed
and fitted for carnivorous purposes. Such an under-lip
as I have described is found in the tribe of dragon-flies
(<i>Libellulina</i>); varied, however, considerably in its figure
in the different genera. In the larva of <i>Libellula</i> Fab.,
such as <i>Libellula depressa</i>, &amp;c. it is of the shape above
described; so exactly resembling a mask, that if Entomologists
ever went to masquerades, they could not more
effectually relieve the insipidity of such amusements and
attract the attention of the <i>demoiselles</i>, than by appearing
at the supper table with a <i>mask</i> of this construction, and
serving themselves by its assistance. It would be difficult,
to be sure, by mechanism to supply the place of the muscles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
with which in the insect it is amply provided: but
Merlin, or his successor, has surmounted greater obstacles.
In the larva of the Fabrician <i>ÃshnÃ¦</i> (<i>Libellula
grandis</i>, &amp;c. L.), this apparatus is not convex but flat:
so that, though it equally conceals the face, it does not so
accurately resemble a mask; and the jaws at its apex are
not convex plates, but rather two single conical teeth<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.
It is, as to its general shape, similarly constructed in
<i>Agrion</i> Fab. (<i>L. Virgo</i>, &amp;c. L.); but the first joint is
more remarkably elongated, the jaws more precisely resemble
jaws than in any of the rest, and are armed with
three long, very sharp teeth: between them also there is
a lozenge-shaped opening, through which, when the apparatus
is closed, is protruded a circular sort of nipple,
apparently analogous to the ligula<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>. <i>Libellula Ã¦nea</i>, L.,
which is the type of another tribe (<i>Cordulia</i> Leach), has
a mask somewhat different from all the above, the jaws being
armed with a moveable claw and an internal tooth<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.
You will admire the wisdom of this admirable contrivance,
when you reflect that these larvÃ¦ are not fitted to
pursue their prey with rapidity, like most predaceous
animals; but that they steal upon them, as De Geer observes<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>,
as a cat does upon a bird, very slowly, and as if
they counted their steps; and then, by a sudden evolution
of this machine, take them as it were by surprise,
when they think themselves safe. De Geer says, it is
very difficult for other insects to elude their attacks, and
that he has even seen them devour very small fishes<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
As these animals are found in almost every ditch, you
will doubtless lose no time in examining for yourself an
instance of so singular a construction.</p>

<p><i>Feelers</i> (<span class="smcap">Palpi</span>). In the orders <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Hymenoptera</i>
are many larvÃ¦ in which these organs have not
been certainly discovered; yet Reaumur in that of a common
fly (<i>M. meridiana</i> L.) found four retractile nipples<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
which seem analogous to them; and Latreille has observed,
that below the mandibles of those of ants are
four minute points, two on each side<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>: but in all other
larvÃ¦ their existence is more clearly ascertained. The
<i>maxillary</i> palpi vary in <i>number</i>, many having <i>two</i> on
each maxilla and others only <i>one</i>. In the perfect insect
the former is one of the distinguishing characters of the
predaceous beetles (<i>Entomophagi</i> Latr.), but in the larvÃ¦
it is more widely extended; since even in the caterpillars
of <i>Lepidoptera</i> the inner lobe of the maxilla which represents
this feeler is jointed, which is precisely the case
with the beetles just named. Cuvier has observed this
circumstance in the larva of the stag-beetle<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>; and it belongs
to many other <i>Coleoptera</i> that have only a pair of
maxillary palpi in the perfect state. The <i>labial</i> palpi are
always two, emerging usually one on each side from the
apex of the under-lip. With regard to the <i>form</i> of the
palpi, those of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> are mostly conical; in
other orders they are sometimes setaceous and sometimes
filiform. Their termination is generally simple,
but sometimes the last joint is divided. They are for the
most part very short, and the labial shorter than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
maxillary. The latter never exceed <i>four</i> joints<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>, which
seems the most natural number; and the former are limited
to <i>three</i>. Both vary between these numbers, and <i>one</i>
joint. The joints, though commonly simple, are sometimes
branched. This is the case with one I met with in considerable
numbers upon the Turnip, in October 1808,
the second joint of the palpi of which sends forth near
the apex an internal branch. In the larva of the <i>Cossus</i>,
as Lyonnet informs us<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>, the joints of the palpi are retractile,
so that the whole of the organ may be nearly
withdrawn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After thus describing the <i>head</i> of larvÃ¦, and its principal
organs, we must next say something upon the remainder
of the body, or what constitutes the</p>

<p>2. <i>Trunk and Abdomen</i>: which I shall consider under
one article. These are composed of several <i>segments</i> or
rings, to which the feet and other appendages of the
body are fixed. The form of these segments, or that of
their vertical section, varies considerably: in many <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
the wire-worm, &amp;c., it would be nearly circular;
in others a greater or less segment of a circle would represent
it; and in some, perhaps, it would consist of two
such segments applied together. Their lower surface is
generally nearly plane. Their most natural <i>number</i>,
without the head and including the anal segment, is
twelve: this they seldom exceed, and perhaps never
fourteen. The three first segments are those which represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the <i>trunk</i> of the perfect insect, and to which the
six anterior legs when present are affixed. In general,
they differ from the remaining segments only in being
shorter, and in many cases less distinctly characterized;
but in Neuropterous larvÃ¦, those of <i>Dytisci</i>, and some
other <i>Coleoptera</i>, they are longer than the succeeding
ones, and pretty nearly resemble the trunk of the animal
in its last state. The surface of the trunk and abdomen
will be considered under a subsequent head; I shall not,
therefore, describe it here. The <i>conformation</i> of the different
segments varies but little, except of the terminal
one, or tail, which in different larvÃ¦ takes various figures.
In most, this part is obtuse and rounded; in others acute
or acuminate; in others truncate; and in others emarginate,
or with a wider sinus, and with intermediate modifications
of shape which it would be endless to particularize.
In some, also, it is simple and unarmed; in others beset
with horns, spines, radii, and tubercles of different
forms, some of which will come under future consideration.
The parts connected with the trunk and abdomen
which will require separate consideration, are the
<i>legs</i>, the <i>spiracles</i>, and various <i>appendages</i>.</p>

<p><i>Legs.</i> It may be stated generally that the larvÃ¦ of the
orders <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and <i>Neuroptera</i>, have
legs; and that those of the orders <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>
have none. This must be understood, however,
with some exceptions. Thus the larvÃ¦ of some <i>Coleoptera</i>,
as the weevil tribes (<i>Curculio</i> L.) have no legs, unless
we may call by that name certain fleshy tubercles besmeared
with gluten, which assist them in their motions<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
while those of <i>Tenthredo</i> and <i>Sirex</i> in the order <i>Hymenoptera</i>
are furnished with these organs. At present I
know no Dipterous larva that may be said to have <i>real</i>
legs, unless we are to regard as such certain tentacula
formed upon a different model from the legs of other larvÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>.
RÃ¶sel has, I think, figured a Lepidopterous apode.
No Neuropterous one has yet been discovered.</p>

<p>The legs of larvÃ¦ are of two kinds; either horny and
composed of joints, or fleshy and without joints<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>. The
first of these, as I observed in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>, are the
principal instruments of locomotion, and the last are to
be regarded chiefly as props and stays by which the animal
keeps its long body from trailing, or by which it
takes hold of surfaces; while the other legs, or where
there are none, the annuli of its body, regulate its motions.
The former have been commonly called <i>true legs</i>
(<i>pedes veri</i>), because they are persistent, being found in
the perfect insect as well as in the larva; and the latter
<i>spurious legs</i> (<i>pedes spurii</i>), because they are caducous,
being found in the larva only. Instead of these not very
appropriate names, I shall employ for the former the
simple term <i>legs</i>, and for the latter <i>prolegs</i> (<i>propedes</i>)<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>.</p>

<p>The legs, when present, are always in number <i>six</i>, and
attached by pairs to the underside of the three first segments
of the trunk. They are of a horny substance, and
consist usually of the same parts as those of the perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
insect; namely, <i>coxa</i>, <i>trochanter</i>, <i>femur</i>, <i>tibia</i>, and <i>tarsus</i>,
suspended to each other by membranous ligaments: these
parts are less distinctly marked in some than in others.
Thus in the legs of a caterpillar, or the grub of a capricorn-beetle,
at first you would think there were only three
or four joints besides the claw; but upon a nearer inspection,
you would discover at the base of the leg the rudiments
of two others<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>, in the latter represented indeed by
the fleshy protuberance from which the legs emerge.
In the larvÃ¦ of the predaceous <i>Coleoptera</i>, the hip and
trochanter are as conspicuous nearly as in the perfect
insect; and the tarsus, which still consists of only a single
joint, is armed with two claws<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>. In those of the
<i>Neuroptera</i> order, in which all the joints are very conspicuous,
the tarsi are jointed, as well as two-clawed<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.
The legs of larvÃ¦ are usually shorter than those of the
perfect insect, and scarcely differ from each other in
shape, for they all gradually decrease in diameter from
the base to the apex. This is the most usual conformation
of them in Lepidopterous, Hymenopterous, and
some Coleopterous larvÃ¦, (those of the capricorn-beetles
are very short and minute, so as to be scarcely visible,)
in which they are so small as to be concealed by the body
of the insect<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>. In Neuropterous larvÃ¦, however, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
several <i>Coleoptera</i>, as those of <i>Dytiscus</i>, <i>Staphylinus</i>, <i>Coccinella</i>,
&amp;c., they more resemble the legs of the perfect
insect, the joints being more elongated, and the femoral
one projecting beyond the body<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.</p>

<p>You will find no other than true legs in most Coleopterous,
Neuropterous, and Hymenopterous larvÃ¦. But
those of the saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.), and all caterpillars,
have besides a number of <i>prolegs</i>: a few Dipterous larvÃ¦
also, are provided with some organs nearly analogous to
them. These <i>prolegs</i> are fleshy, commonly conical or
cylindrical, and sometimes retractile protuberances, usually
attached by pairs to the underside of that part of
the body that represents the abdomen of the future fly<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>.
They vary in conformation and in number; some having
but one, others as many as eighteen.</p>

<p>With regard to their <i>conformation</i>, they may be divided
into two principal sections: first, those furnished
with terminal claws; and secondly, those deprived of
them. Each of which may be divided into smaller sections,
founded on the general figure of the prolegs, and
arrangement of the claws or hooks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>i. The prolegs of almost all Lepidopterous larvÃ¦ are
furnished with a set of minute slender horny hooks, crotchets,
or <i>claws</i>, of different lengths, somewhat resembling
fish-hooks; which either partially or wholly surround
the apex like a pallisade. By means of these
claws, of which there are from forty to sixty in each
proleg, a short and a long one arranged alternately, the
insect is enabled to cling to smooth surfaces, to grasp
the smallest twigs to which the legs could not possibly
adhere: a circumstance which the flexible nature of
the prolegs greatly facilitates<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>. Claws nearly similar
are found on the prolegs of some <i>Dipterous</i> larvÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>, but
not in any of those of the other orders. These last, however,
are seldom either so numerous, or arranged in
the same manner, as in caterpillars. When the sole of
the foot is open, the claws with which it is more or less
surrounded are turned outwards, and are in a situation
to lay hold of any surface; but when the animal wishes
to let go its hold, it begins to draw in the skin of the sole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and in proportion as this is retracted, the claws turn
their points inwards, so as not to impede its motion<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>.</p>

<p>The prolegs with claws may be further divided into
four different kinds.</p>

<p>1. In the larvÃ¦ of the great majority of butterflies
and moths they assume the form of a truncated cone,
the lower and smaller end of which is expanded into a
semicircular or subtriangular plate, having the inner
half of its circumference beset with the claws above mentioned;
and, from its great power of dilating and contracting,
admirably adapted for performing the offices of
a foot. Jungius calls these legs <i>pedes elephantini</i><a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>; and
the term is not altogether inapplicable, since they exhibit
considerable resemblance to the clumsy but accommodating
leg and foot of the gigantic animal he alludes to.</p>

<p>2. The larvÃ¦ of many minute moths, particularly of
the Fabrician genera <i>Tortrix</i> and <i>Tinea</i>&mdash;those which
live in convoluted leaves, the interior of fruits, &amp;c., as well
as the <i>Cossus</i>, and some other large moths,&mdash;have their
prolegs of a form not very unlike those of the preceding
class, but shorter, and without any terminal expansion;
the apex, moreover, is wholly, instead of half, surrounded
with claws<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>; the additional provision of which, together
with a centrical kind of nipple capable of being
protruded or retracted, in some measure, though imperfectly,
supplies the place of the more flexible plate-like
expansion present in the first class.</p>

<p>3. The third class is composed of a very few <i>Lepidopterous</i>
larvÃ¦ which have their prolegs very thick and
conical at the base, but afterwards remarkably slender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
long, and cylindrical, so as exactly to assume the shape
of a wooden leg<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>. These, as in the first class, are expanded
at the end into a flat plate: but this is wholly circular,
is surrounded with claws, and has also in the middle
a retractile nipple, as in the preceding class. In
<i>Cossus</i>, at least in an American species (<i>Cossus RobiniÃ¦</i>),
described by Professor Peck<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>, the anal prolegs have the
claws only on their <i>exterior</i> half.</p>

<p>4. The remaining description of unguiferous prolegs,
if they may not rather be deemed a kind of tentacula,
are those of certain <i>Diptera</i>, provided with no true legs;
which differ from the three preceding classes, either in
their shape, or the arrangement of their claws. In
one kind of those remarkable larvÃ¦, which from their
long respiratory anal tubes Reaumur denominates "<i>rat-tailed</i>,"
that of <i>Elophilus pendulus</i>, there are fourteen of
these prolegs, affixed by pairs to the ventral segments,
the twelve posterior ones of which are subconical, and
truncate at the apex, which is surrounded with two circles
of very minute claws, those of the inner being much
more numerous and shorter than those of the exterior
circle; while the anterior pair terminate in a flat expansion,
and in shape almost exactly resemble those of a mole<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.
The prolegs of the larvÃ¦ of a kind of gnat called by
De Geer <i>Tipula amphibia</i>, and of <i>Syrphus mystaceus</i> F.,
(<i>Musca plumata</i> De Geer,) are nearly of a similar construction,
but in the last are armed with three claws
only<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>. Long moveable claws also distinguish the singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
prolegs before described<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> of another gnat (<i>Tanypus
maculatus</i> Meig., <i>Tipula</i> De Geer). The case-worms
(<i>Trichoptera</i> K.) and some others, have two prolegs at
the anus, each furnished with a single claw<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>.</p>

<p>ii. The prolegs <i>deprived</i> of <i>claws</i> are found in the
larva of the Hymenopterous tribe of saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i>
L.), in those of some <i>Lepidoptera</i> (<i>Hepialus</i> F. &amp;c.), and
in some few Coleopterous and Dipterous genera. Those
of the former are of the shape of a truncated cone, and
resemble the second class of unguiculate prolegs, except
in the defect of claws. In the latter they are a mere retractile
nipple-like protuberance, in some species so small
as scarcely to be perceptible. In all they aid in progressive
motion; but it is by laying hold of surfaces, and so
enabling the body more readily to push itself forward by
annular contraction and dilatation, and not by taking
steps, of which all prolegs are incapable: to assist in this
purpose the protuberance sometimes secretes a gluten<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>,
which supplies the place of claws. Some larvÃ¦ have the
power of voluntarily dilating certain portions of the underside
of their body, so as to assume nearly the shape
and to perform the functions of prolegs. In a Coleopterous
(?) subcortical one from Brazil, before alluded to,
there are four round and nearly flat areas in each ventral
segment of the abdomen, but the last very little raised
above the surface, and rough, somewhat like a file; and
besides these, the base of the anal segment has ten of
these little rough spaces, but of a different shape, being
nearly linear, placed in a double series, five on each side.
Doubtless these may be regarded as a kind of <i>prolegs</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
which enable the animal to push itself along between the
bark and the wood<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.</p>

<p>In considering, in the next place, the <i>number</i> and <i>situation</i>
of the prolegs, it will contribute to distinctness to
advert to these circumstances as they occur in the different
orders furnished with these organs.</p>

<p>To begin with the <i>Lepidoptera</i>.&mdash;Lepidopterous larvÃ¦
have either ten, eight, six, or two prolegs, seldom more<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>,
and never fewer. Of these, with a very few exceptions,
two are attached to the last or anal, and the rest, when
present, to one or more of the <i>sixth</i>, <i>seventh</i>, <i>eighth</i>, and
<i>ninth</i> segments of the body: none are ever found on the
fourth, fifth, tenth, or eleventh segments.</p>

<p>1. Where <i>ten</i> prolegs are present, as is the case in by
far the greatest proportion of Lepidopterous larvÃ¦, there
is constantly an anal pair, and a pair on each of the four
intermediate segments just mentioned.</p>

<p>2. In caterpillars, which like those of a few species of
the genera <i>Sphinx</i>, <i>Pyralis</i>, and of the <i>BombycidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c.
have <i>eight</i> legs, they are placed in <i>three</i> different ways. In
those which have an anal pair, the remaining six are in
some fixed to the sixth, seventh, and eighth; in others, to
the seventh, eighth, and ninth segments. In those which,
like <i>Cerura Vinula</i>, and several other species of the
same family, have no anal prolegs; the whole eight
emerge from the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth segments.</p>

<p>3. The Hemigeometers, as <i>Noctua Gamma</i>, &amp;c. have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
only <i>six</i> legs: namely, an anal pair, and two ventral ones,
situated on the eighth and ninth segments.</p>

<p>4. The larvÃ¦ of the Geometers (<i>GeometrÃ¦</i> F.) have
but <i>four</i> prolegs; of which two are anal, and two spring
from the ninth segment. It should be observed, however,
that the larvÃ¦ of Hemigeometers, and even of some
of those that have ten prolegs, where the four anterior ones
are much shorter than the rest, move in the same way as
the Geometers. This even prevails in a few where these
organs are all of equal length.</p>

<p>5. Many of the larvÃ¦ of <i>Tinea</i> L. which live in the interior
of fruits, seeds, &amp;c., have but <i>one</i> pair of prolegs,
which are attached to the anal segment.</p>

<p>6. The larvÃ¦ of Haworth's genus <i>Apoda</i> (<i>Hepialus
Testudo</i> and <i>Asellus</i> F.), remarkable for their slug-like
shape and appearance, move by the aid of two lateral
longitudinal pustule-like protuberances, which leave a
trace of a gummy slime in their course.</p>

<p><i>Hymenoptera.</i>&mdash;The larvÃ¦ of the different tribes of
<i>Tenthredo</i> L., almost the only Hymenopterous insects in
which prolegs are present, have a variable number of these
organs; some sixteen, as the saw-fly of the willow (<i>T. lutea</i>
L.), and this is the most numerous tribe of them, including
the modern genera, <i>Cimbex</i> F., <i>Pterophorus</i>, &amp;c.
Others have fourteen, as that of the cherry (<i>T. cerasi</i> L.);
and many others with only nine joints to their antennÃ¦.
A third class have only twelve, as that of the rose (<i>T. RosÃ¦</i>
L.), but this contains but few species. The last class
contains those that have no prolegs at all, but only the six
horny ones appended to the trunk. Of this tribe, the
caterpillars of which have a very different aspect from
the preceding, are those of the genus <i>Lyda</i> F. (<i>T. crythrocephala</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
L.)<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>. Two of the prolegs are anal, and the
rest intermediate, and none are furnished with claws.
This circumstance, in conjunction with the greater number
of prolegs, except in the case of <i>Lyda</i>, will always
serve as a mark to distinguish these <i>fausses chenilles</i>, as
the French call the larvÃ¦ of saw-flies, from true <i>caterpillars</i>.
The <i>dorsal</i> prolegs of a species of <i>Cynips</i> described
by Reaumur have been before noticed.</p>

<p><i>Coleoptera.</i>&mdash;The larvÃ¦ of insects of this order are so
little known or attended to, that no very accurate generalization
of them in this respect is practicable. Many of
them, in addition to their six horny legs, have a proleg
at the anus; which in many cases appears to be the last
segment of the abdomen, forming an obtuse angle with
the remainder of it, so as to support that part of the body,
and prevent it from trailing; and in some instances, as
in <i>Chrysomela Populi</i>, a common beetle, secreting a slimy
matter to fix itself<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>. In the larvÃ¦ of <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i> this
proleg is very long and cylindrical; in that of <i>Cicindela</i>
it is shorter, and in shape a truncated cone rather
compressed; it is very short, also, in those of the <i>SilphÃ¦</i>
that I have seen. In the wire-worm (<i>Elater Segetum</i>) it
is a minute retractile tubercle, placed in a nearly semicircular
space, shut in by the last <i>dorsal</i> segment, which
becomes also ventral at the anus. This space is in fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the last ventral segment. This seems characteristic of
the genus<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>. From the underside of the body of the
common meal-worm (<i>Tenebrio Molitor</i>), at the junction
of the two last segments, when the animal walks, there
issues a fleshy part, furnished below with two rather hard,
long, and moveable pediform pieces, which the animal
uses in walking<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>. In the larva of another beetle, whose
ravages have been before noticed, under the name of the
cadelle<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> (<i>Trogosita mauritanica</i>), a pair of prolegs are
said to be found under the anal segment; and in that of
the bloody-nose beetle (<i>Timarcha tenebricosa</i>), that segment
is bifid. That of the weevil of the common water-hemlock
(<i>Lixus paraplecticus</i> F.) exhibits a singular anomaly:
prolegs occupy the usual station of the true legs,
being attached to the three segments representing the
trunk<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. This insect, however, does not appear to use
them in moving. A pair in each of the twelve segments
of the body are found in the grub of another weevil
(<i>Hypera Rumicis</i> Germ.), the nine last pair being the
shortest, which all assist the insect in walking<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>. But the
greatest number of prolegs is to be found in the Brazil
subcortical larva lately mentioned. Besides the six horny
legs of the trunk, this remarkable animal has four prolegs
on each of the seven intermediate abdominal segments,
and five on each side of the base of the last,
making the whole number of prolegs, if so they may
be called, amount to forty-four: a far greater number
than is to be found in any larva at present known. When
I wrote to you upon the motions of insects, I informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
you that some larvÃ¦ moved by means of legs upon their
back<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>, but I was not then aware that any were furnished
with them both on the back and the belly at the same
time. By the kindness of Mr. Joseph Sparshall of Norwich,
a very ardent and indefatigable entomologist, I am
in possession of the larva of <i>Rhagium fasciatum</i>, a timber-feeding
beetle. This animal on the ten intermediate segments
of the underside of the body, which in the centre
form a fleshy protuberance, has on it a double series of
rasps, as it were, consisting each of two rows of oblique
oblong prominences; and on the seven intermediate <i>dorsal</i>
segments there are also in the centre seven rasps of
three or four rows each, of similar prominences: so that
this animal at the same time can push itself along both by
dorsal and ventral prolegs. It is worthy of observation,
that a pair of these rasps is between the second and third
pair of true legs.</p>

<p><i>Diptera.</i>&mdash;The larva of a little gnat, <i>Tipula stercoraria</i>
De Geer<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> (<i>Chironomus</i> Meig.?), drags itself along by
the assistance of a <i>single</i> tubercle, placed on the underside
of the first segment of the body, which the animal
has the power of lengthening or contracting<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>. That of
another beautiful <i>Chironomus</i> (<i>C. plumosus</i>), remarkable
for the feathered antennÃ¦ of the male<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>, has <i>two</i> short
prolegs, or pediform but not retractile tentacula in the
same situation<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>. Others, as that of <i>Tanypus maculatus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
&amp;c. have <i>two pairs</i>, one attached to the anal and the
other to the first segment<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>. <i>Tipula amphibia</i> De Geer
in this state has <i>ten</i> prolegs, placed by pairs on the fourth,
fifth, eighth, ninth, and tenth <i>dorsal</i> segments<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>; and
<i>ScÃ¦va Pyrastri</i> F., one of the aphidivorous flies, has not
fewer than <i>forty-two</i>, arranged in a sextuple series, seven
in each row<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

<p>It may not be useless to close this long description of
the <i>legs</i> of larvÃ¦ with a tabular view of them, founded
chiefly upon these organs; which afford very obvious
marks of distinction.</p>

<p>I should next say something upon the spiracles, or
breathing-pores, or any other external apparatus for the
purpose of <i>respiration</i>, in larvÃ¦; but I think it will be
best to reserve the consideration of these for a subsequent
Letter. We will therefore conclude this detailed description
of their parts in their first state, with some account
of their other.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Appendages.</i> The generality of larvÃ¦ have no other
external organs than those already described; but in several
of them we observe various kinds of retractile ones
and others&mdash;protuberances&mdash;horn-like processes&mdash;rays,
&amp;c.; which, though not properly coming either under
any of the above <i>parts</i>, or under the <i>clothing</i> of these
animals, yet require to be noticed. Upon these I shall
now enlarge a little.</p>

<p>You must have observed upon the back of the last segment
but one of the caterpillar of the silk-worm a horn-like
process, rising at first nearly perpendicularly, and
then bending forward. A similar horn, though confined
in the genus <i>Bombyx</i> to the silk-worm and a few others,
if we may believe Madame Merian, who, however, often
makes great mistakes, is found in the beautiful caterpillar
of one of the largest and finest moths that we know
(<i>Erebus Strix</i><a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>), the glory of the <i>NoctuidÃ¦</i>, and in most
of those of the hawk-moths (<i>Sphinx</i> F.) [<i>S. Porcellus</i>, <i>Vitis</i>,
and a few others excepted; in some of which, as
<i>S. LabruscÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., this anal horn is replaced by a gibbosity,
and in others, as <i>S. &#338;notherÃ¦</i>, by a callous eye-like
plate<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>] in the same situation, but much longer<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
commonly curving backwards over the tail<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>. Sometimes,
however, as in <i>S. ocellata</i> and <i>S. Stellatarum</i>, it is
perfectly straight. These organs towards the apex are
horny, and often end in a sharp point; nearer the base
they are fleshy. They are without any true joint<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>, yet
the insect can elevate or depress them at pleasure. Under
a lens, they usually appear covered with spinous eminences,
arranged like scales. The use of these horns is
quite unknown: Goedart fancies that they secrete a potent
poison, and are intended as instruments of defence;
but both suppositions are altogether unfounded. It has
been remarked, that the body of those caterpillars which
have these horns, is firmer, and yields less to the touch
than that of those which have no such appendages<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>. The
larva of a small timber-devouring beetle (<i>Lymexylon dermestoides</i>
F.) has, like the above caterpillars, a long horn,
and in the same situation: it has also a singular protuberance
on the first segment<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>. Upon some other caterpillars,
as in <i>Bombyx Stigma</i> F., a singular pair of horn-like
appendages arises from the back of the second segment of
the body, excluding the head. In a tawny-coloured one
from Georgia, with a transverse row of short black spines
on each segment, these horns are half an inch long,
black, covered with spinous eminences, rather thickest at
the base, and terminate in a little knob. They appear to
articulate with the body at the lower extremity. I have
another species, black, with narrow longitudinal yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
stripes, in which these horns are of equal thickness at
base and apex, but with the same terminal knob. <i>Danais
Archippus</i> has a pair of tentacula at the head, and
another pair, but shorter, at the tail; and <i>D. Gylippus</i>
has, besides these, two in the middle of the body<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.</p>

<p>We are equally ignorant of the use of the upright horn
found upon the back of the fourth segment in the larva of
some moths (<i>Noctua Psi</i>, and <i>tridens</i> F.) which is of a construction
quite different from that of those last described.
It is cylindrical, slightly thinner at the apex, which is
obtuse, fleshy, incapable of motion, of a black colour, and
about two lines long. On the same segment, also, in the
case-worms (<i>Trichoptera</i> K.) are three fleshy conical eminences,
which the animal can inflate or depress, so that
they sometimes totally disappear, and then in an instant
swell out again. When retracted, they form a tunnel-shaped
cavity, varying in depth<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>. Reaumur conjectured
that these eminences were connected with respiration,
and one circumstance seems in favour of this conjecture,
that this segment has not the respiratory threads observable
in the subsequent ones. Latreille mentions certain
fleshy naked eminences placed upon the ninth and tenth
segments of some hairy caterpillars, which, like those just
mentioned, the animal can elevate more or less. They
are often little cones; but when it would shorten them,
the summit is drawn in, and a tunnel appears where before
there was a pyramid<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.</p>

<p>In a former Letter I gave you a short account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
remarkable Y-shaped, as it should seem, scent-organs
(<i>Osmateria</i>) of the beautiful caterpillar of the swallow-tailed
butterfly (<i>Papilio Machaon</i> L.), and others of the
<i>Equites</i><a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>; I will now speak of them more fully. That
found in the former is situated at the anterior margin at
the back of the first segment, close to the head, from
which at first view it seems to proceed. At the bottom
it is simple, but divides towards the middle, like the letter
Y, into two forks, of a fleshy substance<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>, which it can
lengthen, as a snail does its horns, to five times their ordinary
extent, or retract them within the stalk, so as wholly
to conceal them. Sometimes it protrudes one fork, keeping
the other retracted; and often withdraws the whole
apparatus for hours together under the skin, and its
place is only marked by two tawny-coloured dots, so that
an ordinary spectator would not suspect the existence of
such an instrument<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>. Unfortunately this larva is rare
in this country, so that I can scarcely flatter you with the
hope of seeing this curious organ in a living specimen<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>,
unless you choose to import a parcel of its eggs from the
south of Europe, where it is common. This you will
think rather a wild proposition; but why should not Entomologists
import the eggs of rare insects, as well as botanists
the seeds of rare plants? But if you will be satisfied
with the dissection of a dead specimen, I have several,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
done by the ingenious Mr. Abbott of Georgia, in
which this part is well exhibited<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.</p>

<p>Another small caterpillar, as it should seem, of a geometer,
prepared by the same gentleman, exhibits a pair
of similar horns on the fifth and sixth segments: in these
the common base from which the fork proceeds is very
short and wide, and each branch grows gradually more
slender from the base to the apex, where it is involute.
Whether these are retractile, or whether they correspond
with those of <i>P. Machaon</i> in their nature and use, cannot
be ascertained from a dead specimen: as they belong to a
larva of a quite different tribe of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the probability
is, that they essentially differ. Two globose retractile
vesicles issue from the ninth and tenth segments
of those of <i>Arctia chrysorrhea</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>A great number of Lepidopterous larvÃ¦, particularly
those which are smooth and of a moderate size, have between
the under-lip and fore-legs a slender transverse opening,
containing a teat-like protuberance of the same construction
as the furcate horn of the caterpillar of the beautiful
mountain-butterfly, <i>Parnassius Apollo</i>; and, like that,
can either be wholly retracted and concealed, or by pressure
be extended to the length of one of the legs. In some
larvÃ¦ this part is of a subhemispherical figure, generally
single, but sometimes double. It is commonly, however,
more slender and conical; and when of this shape, it is
sometimes quadruple<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. The use of this part is not very
clearly known: some have supposed it to be a second
spinneret, and to be of use in fabricating the cocoon; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
it is more probable that it secretes some other kind of
fluid, and is connected with defence.</p>

<p>The singular organ in a similar situation, evidently
for that purpose, with which the puss-moth endeavours
to annoy its assailants, has been described in a former
Letter, to which I refer you<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. Bonnet, who was the first
that discovered this organ, ascertained that it might be
cut off without injury to either larva or imago. He also
remarked in a caterpillar found in the wild succory (<i>Cichorium
Intybus</i>) another short, black, needle-shaped organ
between the conical part just described and the under-lip<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.
De Geer mentions a remarkable fleshy horn-like
style, which issues from the lower side of the first
segment, between the head and the legs of the case-worms
(<i>Trichoptera</i>): he does not describe it as retractile, or it
might be regarded as analogous to those of <i>Lepidoptera</i>
similarly situated, that I have just noticed<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>. In that of
the emperor-moth (<i>Saturnia Pavonia</i>), there are perforated
tubercles, which when the animal is molested spirt
forth a transparent fluid<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>.</p>

<p>The horn-like appendage of the puss-moth (<i>Cerura Vinula</i>)
is situated at the tail of the insect, and is composed
of two distinct cylindrical diverging branches, each about
four lines long, not united at the base. Each of these is
hollow, and includes a smaller cylindrical piece, which
can be protruded at pleasure, and withdrawn again, as a
pencil within its case; or, rather, as the horns of a snail.
The two outer horns are tolerably firm, moveable at their
base, and beset with black spines; the interior tentacula
are fleshy, moveable in every direction, and in full-grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
larvÃ¦ of a rose colour. The animal seldom protrudes
them, unless in some way disturbed; and frequently it
approximates the two outer cases so closely that they resemble
a single horn. It appears to use these inner horns,
when protruded, as a kind of whip to drive away the
flies, especially the Ichneumons, that alight upon its body.
When touched in any place, it will unsheath one of them,
and sometimes both, and with them strike the place where
it is incommoded<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>. A similar organ is found in some
other <i>BombycidÃ¦</i>, as <i>B. Tau</i> and <i>Furcula</i> F. Reaumur
mentions a caterpillar that to this kind of tail added the
resemblance of two ears, or two cylindrical bodies, terminating
in a point, which emerged from the first segment
behind the head<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>. In another observed by the same author,
the legs were replaced by a single horn, but which
did not appear to send forth an internal one: from the
back of its fourth segment also emerged a single conical
or pyramidal fleshy eminence or cleft, terminating in two
points<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>. Some of the tropical butterflies also, as may be
seen in the figures of Madame Merian, have two diverging
anal horns instead of anal prolegs; but it does not
appear that they incase tentacula<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>. Wherever these
caudal horns are found, the above prolegs are wanting<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Two conical anal horns also distinguish the caterpillar
of one of the moths called <i>Prominents</i>, <i>Notodonta camelina</i>;
but these are not terminal, but on the back of
the last segment but one<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>. In that of another British
moth, <i>N. ziczac</i> F., there are three dorsal prominences,
one near the anus, and two more in the middle<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>.
Some Geometers (<i>G. fuliginosa</i>, &amp;c.) have two erect
horns on the eleventh segment, and others (<i>G. syringaria</i>,
&amp;c.) two recurved ones on the eighth<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>. I must not here
omit to mention the curious hooks emerging from two tubercles
on the back of the eighth segment of the ferocious
larva of that beautiful tiger-beetle, the <i>Cicindela campestris</i>
L., not uncommon on warm sunny banks. This animal
with incessant labour, as we are informed by M. Desmarets,
digs a cylindrical burrow, to the enormous depth,
the size of the animal considered, of eighteen inches. To
effect this, it carries out small masses of earth upon its large
concave head; and having often occasion to rest in ascending
this height, by means of these hooks<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> it fixes itself
to the sides of its burrow, and, having finally arrived at its
mouth, casts off its burthen. When these insects lie in
wait for their prey, their head, probably in conjunction
with the first segment of the body, accurately stops the
mouth of the burrow, so as to form an exact level with
the surrounding soil; and thus careless insects, walking
over it without perceiving the snare, are seized in a moment
and devoured<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>.</p>

<p>Another kind of appendage, which is found in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
larvÃ¦, is the organ employed by them to carry the excrement;
with which, instead of letting it fall to the ground,
they form a kind of umbrella to shelter and probably conceal
them. All the tortoise-beetles (<i>Cassida</i> L.) have instruments
for this purpose, as well as an Indian genus
(<i>Imatidium</i> Latr.) very nearly related to them. This instrument
is a kind of fork, half as long as the body, consisting
of two branches, growing gradually smaller from
the base to the summit, where they terminate in a very
fine point, of a substance rather horny, and attached to
the body near the anal orifice. They are armed on the
outside with short spines, from the base for about a third
of their length. When this fork, as it usually is, is laid
parallel to the back, with its points towards the head, the
anal aperture points the same way. When the animal
walks, the fork points the other way, and is in the same
line with the body, and the anus assumes a prone position<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ of a genus of flies (<i>Volucella</i> Geoffr.) remarkable
for inhabiting the nests of humble bees, are distinguished
on their upper side by six long, diverging,
pointed, membranous radii; placed in a semicircle round
the anus<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>: what the particular use of these organs may
be, has not been conjectured. Another in my collection
has only four upper radii, but below the anus are two
fleshy filiform tentacula. One of a Tipulidan described
by Reaumur, has also four upper teeth; but instead of
two subanal tentacula, has six<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. The singular larva of
another of this tribe (<i>Chironomus plumosus</i>) has on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
two last segments four long, fleshy, filiform, flexible tentacula,
often interlaced with each other; which, according
to the same illustrious author, are used by the animal
to fix its caudal extremity, like the geometers, that the
other end may be at liberty. Besides these organs round
the anus, it has also four other oval ones, of uncertain
use: not to mention the two prolegs, which M. Latreille
thinks are air-tubes<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>. Jointed anal organs are observable
in other larvÃ¦: those in that of a saw-fly described
by De Geer (<i>Lyda</i> F.) consist of three joints<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>; in that
of <i>Hister cadaverinus</i>, a carnivorous beetle, of two<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>.
The larva as well as the pupa and imago of <i>Ephemera</i>
is furnished with three long diverging multiarticulate
tails, which are probably useful as a kind of rudder to
assist and direct their motions. That of the smaller
dragon flies (<i>Agrion</i> F.) is furnished with three long vertical
laminÃ¦, by moving which, as fish do their tails,
from side to side, the animal makes its way in the water<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>.
That singular one, also, with a hooked head, figured by
Reaumur, has a single swimming lamina, or fin, shaped
like a fan, and placed in a vertical position under the
tail<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>.</p>

<p>The whole circumference of the body in some coleopterous
larvÃ¦,&mdash;for instance, in that of the tortoise-beetle
lately mentioned,&mdash;is surrounded with appendages like
rays. These are sometimes simple, rough with very
short spinous points<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>; but I have a dipterous larva, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
which these radii themselves are beautifully pinnated by
a fringe of longish spines on each side. Reaumur has described
the grub of a beetle, the genus of which is uncertain,
and which feeds upon the larva of <i>Aleyrodes Proletella</i>,
whose body is margined on each side by eight triangular
fleshy mammular processes, terminating each in
a bristle, which give it a remarkable aspect<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>. The curious
scent-organs with which the larva of <i>Chrysomela
Populi</i> is fringed have been before fully described; and
therefore I shall only mention them here<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.</p>

<p>In the larvÃ¦ of the lace-winged flies (<i>Hemerobius</i>), and
ant-lions (<i>Myrmeleon</i>), the anus is furnished with a small
fleshy retractile cylinder, from which proceeds the silken
thread that forms the cocoon inclosing the pupa<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>. Providence
has many different ways of performing the same
operation. From the structure of the oral organs of
these animals, the silk could not conveniently be furnished
by the mouth; the Allwise Creator has therefore
instructed and fitted them to render it by a spinneret at
the other extremity of the body.</p>

<p>The respiratory anal appendages of many Dipterous
larvÃ¦ will be fully described in a subsequent Letter: I
shall therefore now only further observe upon this subject,
that although there is seldom any alteration in the form of
these appendages &amp;c. in the same species, the caterpillars
of two moths (<i>Cerura Vinula</i> and <i>Attacus Tau</i>), however,
are exceptions. The former, when young, has two
hairy projecting ear-like protuberances, which it entirely
loses, as I have myself observed, before it assumes the
pupa; and the latter, in like manner, after its third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
change of skin, is deprived of its bent thorn-like points
which attend it when young<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. It is remarkable that
these last larvÃ¦, when just excluded from the egg, are
also entirely destitute of these appendages; they soon,
however, appear, from slight elevations which mark their
situation, and rapidly acquire their usual form<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. Changes
of a similar kind, hitherto unobserved, may probably
take place in other species.</p>


<p>iii. <i>Figure.</i> I am next to consider the general figure or
shape of larvÃ¦. All of them, with but few exceptions<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>,
agree in having a body more or less constricted at intervals
into a series of rings or <i>segments</i>; usually in number,
<i>twelve</i>; often nearly equal in length, but sometimes
in this respect very dissimilar<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>. The general outline or
shape of the body is extremely various: most frequently
it approaches to cylindrical, as in most of the caterpillars
of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and of the Hymenopterous tribe of saw-flies
(<i>Tenthredo</i> L.). The next most common figure is
that more or less oblong or oval one, sometimes approaching
to conical, found in many of the larvÃ¦ usually
called grubs; such as those of the weevil (<i>Curculio</i> L.) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of the capricorn (<i>Cerambyx</i> L.), and other coleopterous
tribes; of bees, and all Hymenopterous insects but the
saw-flies; and also of a large number of flies (<i>Diptera</i>).
In some the figure approaches to fusiform, as in most of
the moths of the Fabrician genus <i>Lithosia</i>. In others,
as in those of the water-beetles (<i>Dytiscus</i>, &amp;c.), it approaches
to an obovate shape, being widest towards the
head, and terminating in a point at the anus. In others,
again, it is linear; an example of which is that of <i>Staphylinus</i>.
Some are convex, and others gibbous, above, and
flat underneath; as those of <i>Silpha</i>, <i>Chrysomela</i> and many
other beetles. Others are flat, both above and below,
and depressed like a leaf; a remarkable instance of which
has been before noticed<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>. Some are very long, as those
of most <i>Lepidoptera</i>; others very short, as that of the
ant-lion (<i>Myrmeleon</i>). Many other peculiarities of form
in individuals might be instanced; but a dry enumeration
of these would be of no great use to you. They can
only be advantageously learned by the study of good
figures, and by watching the actual metamorphosis of the
singularly-formed larvÃ¦ that you meet with.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of any further specification of individual
forms, I shall now endeavour to give you, as far
as my own knowledge of them and the information I can
collect from other sources will enable me, a larger and
more general view of the kinds of larvÃ¦; for analytical
inquiries lose half their value and importance unless we
proceed to apply them synthetically, by forming, if possible,
into groups the objects with which we are individually
acquainted.</p>

<p>Partial attempts at a synthetical arrangement with regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to the larvÃ¦ of <i>Lepidoptera</i> and the saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i>
L.) have been made both by Reaumur and De
Geer. M. Latreille also has recently given a <i>Tableau
mÃ©thodique et gÃ©nÃ©ral</i> of articulated animals furnished
with jointed legs, considered in their first state<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>. The
former of these is chiefly founded upon the number of
the prolegs, and the latter upon the metamorphosis, prolegs,
habits, head, and parts of the mouth, without any
other notice of the configuration. Mr. Wm. MacLeay,
who, though young in years, is old in science and critical
acumen, has started a perfectly new hypothesis upon this
subject. In the progress of his inquiries into the natural
arrangement of animals, particularly of <i>insects</i> in the
<i>Linnean</i> sense, he has been the first to observe, that the
relation which organized objects bear to each other is of
two kinds; one of real <i>affinity</i>, and the other only of <i>analogy</i>,
or resemblance. This important distinction, upon
which I shall enlarge in a future Letter, when I come to
treat of Systems of Entomology, he has applied, in a way
quite original, to larvÃ¦ in general, but more particularly
to those of the <i>Coleoptera</i> order. For the basis of his
system he assumes a relation of analogy between the
<i>larvÃ¦</i> of Insects that in the progress of their metamorphosis
assume wings, and those that do not, which form
his class <i>Ametabola</i>, so that the prototypes of the former
shall be found amongst the latter<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>. But though Mr.
MacLeay appears to consider the analogy between these
two as <i>primary</i>, he extends it in a <i>secondary</i> sense to the
<i>Crustacea</i>, at least in several instances<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>. Upon this occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
he very judiciously remarks, that "in terming
larvÃ¦ <i>Chilognathiformes</i> or <i>Chilopodiformes</i>, it is not
meant that they are <i>ScolopendrÃ¦</i> or <i>Iuli</i>, or even near to
them in affinity; but only that they are so constructed
that certain analogical circumstances attending them
strongly remind us of these <i>Ametabola</i><a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>." This remark
you will bear in mind while I am treating of this subject.
It should seem from another part of the same paragraph,
that the comparison which our learned Physiologist recommends,
is between the <i>young</i> of the <i>Ametabola</i> and
the larvÃ¦ of the corresponding groups of <i>Coleoptera</i>.
This must be understood to refer chiefly to the young of
the <i>Chilopoda</i> and <i>Chilognatha</i>, since they approach
nearer to them in that state, having then only six legs;
but the rest of the <i>Ametabola</i> should certainly be brought
to this comparison in their adult state: and even the two
former orders in that state more strongly resemble numerous
coleopterous larvÃ¦, than when they are young and
much shorter. I before called your attention to the remarkable
circumstance that contrasts very many larvÃ¦
of Hexapod insects that become winged in their perfect
state with adult <i>Myriapoda</i>: namely, that in one the progress
to this state is by losing their prolegs and shortening
their body; while in the other, the reverse of this
takes place, numerous prolegs and additional segments
being gained before they arrive at maturity<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>. As the
multiplication of organs is a sign of imperfection, it may
be affirmed of the former of these tribes, that their progress
is towards greater perfection; while that of the
other may be called a degradation. As larvÃ¦ may be
regarded as a stepping-stone by which approach is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
from the apterous to the winged tribes of Insects, it seems
most consistent with general analogy that each should
connect with the other in that state in which the resemblance
is greatest. Now the <i>Myriapoda</i> resemble larvÃ¦,
as we have just seen, most when in their <i>adult</i> state;
therefore the comparison should be between larvÃ¦ and
adult <i>Myriapoda</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. MacLeay divides <i>coleopterous</i> larvÃ¦ into five tribes
thus characterized:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>A carnivorous hexapod larva, with an elongate linear
flattened body, having a large head armed with two sharp
falciform mandibles, and furnished with six granular eyes
on each side.</i> This kind he denominates <i>Chilopodiform</i>,
as having for its type in the <i>Ametabola</i>, <i>Scolopendra</i> L.
The examples he gives are <i>Carabus</i> and <i>Dytiscus</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>A herbivorous hexapod larva, with a long and almost
cylindrical body, so fashioned that the posterior extremity
being curved under the breast, the animal when at
rest necessarily lies like an <span class="smcap">Iulus</span> on its side.</i> This tribe
he denominates <i>Chilognathiform</i>, from <i>Iulus</i> L. His examples
are, the larvÃ¦ of <i>Petalocerous</i> insects, as <i>ScarabÃ¦us</i>
L., <i>Lucanus</i> L. &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. <i>An apod larva, having scarcely the rudiments of antennÃ¦,
but which is furnished instead of feet with fat fleshy
tubercles; which, when continued along the back and belly,
give the animal a facility of moving in whatever way it
may be placed.</i> These he denominates <i>Vermiform</i>, from
certain of the <i>Vermes intestina</i> and <i>Mollusca</i> of LinnÃ©
which he has associated with his <i>Annulosa</i><a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>. His examples
are, <i>Curculio</i> L. and <i>Cerambyx</i> L.</p>

<p>4. <i>A hexapod and distinctly antenniferous larva, with a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<i>subovate rather conical body, of which the second segment
is longer and of a different form from the others, so as to
give the appearance of a thorax.</i> His denomination for
these is <i>Anopluriform</i>, from <i>Pediculus</i> L., forming Dr.
Leach's <i>Anoplura</i>. His examples are, <i>Coccinella</i> and
<i>Chrysomela</i> L.</p>

<p>5. <i>A hexapod antenniferous larva of an oblong form,
having like the former vestiges of a thorax, besides two or
more articulated or inarticulated setaceous or corneous appendages
to the last segment of the abdomen.</i> This tribe
he calls <i>Thysanuriform</i>, from <i>Lepisma</i> and <i>Podura</i> L.,
forming M. Latreille's order <i>Thysanura</i>. His example
is <i>Meloe</i> with a note of interrogation<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.</p>

<p>The system here stated, of naming and characterizing
larvÃ¦ from the resemblance and analogy, in many cases
very striking, that they bear to the apterous tribes, is a
very happy and original one, and does its author great
credit; yet I think in some instances, as I shall soon
have occasion to point out to you, the application of it is
not so happy as the first idea. But this is always the
case when a new law of nature is discovered; the proper
application of it is gradually developed, and it does not
at all detract from the merit of the first discoverer, that
all the bearings of such law do not strike him as it were
intuitively.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>
<p>Having, however, got the vantage-ground afforded by
this discovery of my friend, let us see if by standing upon
it we cannot get a tolerable generalization of the larvÃ¦
of all orders of insects that undergo a metamorphosis.
But first I must observe, that as in the perfect animals,
so in their larvÃ¦, the different groups are connected by
certain <i>transition</i> species, exhibiting characters common
to two or more of them; and likewise that in many cases,
which you will see as we proceed, the analogy is as strong
or stronger between them and the <i>Crustacea</i> (and in a
few instances <i>Arachnida</i>, and even <i>Mollusca</i>) than the
<i>Ametabola</i>. My denominations, therefore, will be taken
from those tribes where the analogy appears to me the
most striking, and not from the <i>Ametabola</i> alone.</p>

<p>I shall begin by drawing up for you a list of the Primary
forms that I seem to have observed, and their characters;
and then going through the orders, shall give
you the examples of each, with such observations upon
them as the case may require.</p>

amongst crustaceous forms, because of the remarkable
resemblance which the last segment of the body bears to
that of the <i>IdoteidÃ¦</i>; but I do it with considerable hesitation,
since in other respects its type seems to be in the
<i>Ametabola</i>. In its want of antennÃ¦, very short legs, and
ventral asperities, it resembles some of the <i>Vermiform</i>
larvÃ¦; in its small head, distinct thoracic shield, and oblong

<p>The above are the principal forms that appear to me
<i>Primary</i> (though some doubt may rest upon the ninth
and tenth); and probably others will hereafter be discovered,
since at present our knowledge of the larvÃ¦ of
most of the Orders is very limited. And now having given
you this generalization of them, as far as they are known
to me, I shall next, in a slight survey of those of the different
orders, lay before you what I have further to observe
upon this subject.</p>

<p><i>Coleoptera.</i> The <i>Anopluriform</i> coleopterous larvÃ¦, according
to Mr. W. MacLeay's view of them, include
both those of <i>Coccinella</i> L., <i>Chrysomela</i> L., and <i>Cassida</i>
L.; but this appears to me to admit of further consideration.
With regard to the two former&mdash;those of
<i>Coccinella</i> are carnivorous, those of <i>Chrysomela</i> herbivorous;
the first is also usually more flat and depressed.
As to the latter, <i>Cassida</i><a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>, it seems to me to belong to a
peculiar type, distinguished not only by its radiated margin,
but by the remarkable deflected anal fork on which it
carries its excrement. At present I know no analogous
form amongst the apterous tribes; I must therefore leave
this without a denomination. Perhaps the larva of <i>Hispa</i>
or <i>Alurnus</i>, when known, will throw light upon this subject.
The larva of <i>Endomychus</i> agrees with that of <i>Coccinella</i>.</p>

<p>There are very few known larvÃ¦ that approach to a true
<i>Thysanuriform</i> type in this order: that most celebrated is
the one supposed to belong to <i>Meloe</i>; but the claim of this
to be so considered, is, as we have seen, rather dubious.
Should this point at last be satisfactorily ascertained, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
will probably carry with it the whole tribe of vesicatory
beetles. But even this animal in its <i>general</i> structure is
<i>anopluriform</i>: the only circumstance that gives it any analogy
to the <i>Thysanura</i> being its anal setÃ¦. Mr. William
MacLeay is inclined to regard some of the larvÃ¦ of the
<i>Malacodermi</i> Latr., but which of them he does not state,
as probably belonging to the tribe in question<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>. Those of
<i>Lampyris</i> and of <i>Telephorus</i>, as described and figured by
De Geer<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>, appear to me intermediate between the <i>Anopluriform</i>
and <i>Chilopodiform</i> Types: they have no anal
setiform or styliform appendages, their mandibulÃ¦ are
falcate, and their habits seem carnivorous.</p>

<p>Examples of <i>Chilopodiform</i> coleopterous larvÃ¦ are
more numerous. Of this description are those of <i>Gyrinus</i>,
<i>Cicindela</i>, <i>Carabus</i>, and <i>Staphylinus</i>. That of the
first, indeed, appears to be the most perfectly <i>Scolopendriform</i>
of any yet known; yet the gills or respiratory
laminÃ¦, a pair of which issues from each abdominal segment,
and two pair from the last<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>, prove that there is
no slight analogy between it, and indeed many other
aquatic larvÃ¦, and the <i>Stomapoda</i> amongst the <i>Crustacea</i>.
A remarkable instance of analogy with the <i>Decapoda</i> of
the same <i>Class</i> is presented by the larva of <i>Dytiscus</i>, &amp;c.
which Mr. MacLeay considers as <i>Chilopodiform</i>, but
which exhibits no other resemblance to <i>ScolopendrÃ¦</i> than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
in its predaceous habits and threatening aspect. Its
convex, compressed, tapering body, terminating in setÃ¦
or laminÃ¦, is certainly much more like that of a shrimp
or a prawn; to which the older Entomologists thought it
was akin<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>, and after which they named it. As Mr. MacLeay's
object was, to take all his forms from the <i>Ametabola</i>,
perhaps these larvÃ¦ will best fall in with his <i>Chilopodiform</i>
type; though in the general form of their body
they most represent a section (<i>Lepisma</i> L.) of the <i>Thysanura</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chilognathiform</i> forms are equally numerous in the
Coleoptera with the preceding. The wire-worm, or larva
of <i>Elater Segetis</i>, as to shape best represents the full-grown
<i>Iulus</i><a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>, and those of the <i>Petalocera</i> (<i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> L.,
<i>Lucanus</i> L.) the young one.</p>

<p>The most abundant of all forms in this order, is, I
think, the <i>Vermiform</i>, upon which I have nothing further
to remark.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>Crustaceous</i> forms in <i>Coleoptera</i>, besides
the <i>Decapodiform</i> just noticed, I possess two specimens
of larvÃ¦ of <i>SilphidÃ¦</i> which seem to exhibit a considerable
analogy with the <i>Isopodous Crustacea</i>, one rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
convex and the other flatter, so as to give the idea of an
<i>Armadillo</i> and of an <i>Oniscus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Strepsiptera.</i> Larva <i>Vermiform</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dermaptera.</i> Larva <i>Thysanuriform</i>. Type <i>Podura</i> or
<i>Sminthurus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Orthoptera.</i> Mr. MacLeay considers the larvÃ¦ of this
Order as primarily <i>Thysanuriform</i><a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>, though he allows
the resemblance between them and <i>Amphipoda</i> to be particularly
striking<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>. For my own part, their prototypes appear
to me to be in the <i>Crustacea</i>, and their analogical relations
to the <i>Thysanura</i> much more distant. I trust this
will appear to you the reverse of dubious in a progress
through the Crustaceous Orders. I begin with the <i>Isopoda</i>.
Take the larva of a <i>Blatta</i>, and place it between
a <i>Lepisma</i>, or <i>Machilis</i>, and an <i>Oniscus</i>, or <i>Porcellio</i>;
you will find that in shape and width, and the form of its
anal styles, it resembles the latter much more than it does
the former, with which it possesses scarcely any character
in common, except its multiarticulate antennÃ¦. It is remarkable,
that amongst the <i>BlattidÃ¦</i> we meet with species
that represent both the <i>OniscidÃ¦</i> and <i>Armadillo</i> or
<i>Glomeris</i><a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>, the latter being more convex than the former.
In their habits the BlattÃ¦ certainly agree with <i>Lepisma</i>;
and Dumeril, who thought the latter and <i>Podura</i> subject
to a metamorphosis, imagined they were related<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>.</p>

<p>The Spectres of Stoll (<i>Phasma</i> F.) are so strikingly
analogous to another crustaceous tribe, the <i>LÃ¦modipoda</i>,
particularly the genus <i>Caprella</i>, that Montagu gave one
species the Trivial name of <i>Phasma</i><a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>. The jumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
<i>Amphipodiform</i> Crustacea are represented extremely well by
<i>Gryllus</i> L., and the <i>Stomapodiform</i>, particularly <i>Squilla
Mantis</i>, by <i>Mantis</i>. The resemblance in this last instance
is so very striking, that it cannot escape the eye of the
least intelligent observer. Orthopterous insects may perhaps
one day be discovered analogous to the two other
crustaceous orders, the <i>Decapods</i> and <i>Branchiopods</i>; but
at present I know of none of that description.</p>

<p><i>Hemiptera.</i> The larvÃ¦ of this order, which in general
resemble the perfect insect, except that they have no
wings, seem most commonly to belong to the <i>Anopluriform</i>
type<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>; but the <i>Aphides</i>, <i>Chermes</i>, and <i>Thrips</i> may,
I think, be regarded as more analogous to the genera
<i>Podura</i> and <i>Sminthurus</i> in the <i>Thysanura</i><a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>. I have some
suspicion that the <i>NepidÃ¦</i>, <i>Naucoris</i>, and the remipedes,
<i>Notonecta</i>, <i>Sigara</i>, &amp;c. may find their prototypes amongst
the <i>Crustacea</i>; but my confined knowledge of the latter
does not enable me to point to any individual genera or
tribes that they may be presumed to represent.</p>

<p><i>Neuroptera.</i> As the kinds of larvÃ¦ of the different tribes
composing this order, as it now stands, are very various,
it is to be expected that the analogical forms they represent
are equally so. The <i>Libellulina</i> MacLeay (whose
metamorphosis that gentleman has denominated <i>subsemicomplete</i>,
a term warranted by their losing in their
perfect state the mask before described<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>) in their oral
organs, particularly by their galeate <i>maxilla</i> and distinct
<i>ligula</i><a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>, have some relation to the <i>Orthoptera</i>, the prototypes
of whose larvÃ¦ we have found amongst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
<i>Crustacea</i>: probably, therefore, those of the tribe in question
lurk in that class; a suspicion that receives strong confirmation
from the larva of <i>Agrion</i><a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>, which in its tapering
body and anal natatorious laminÃ¦ represents a shrimp.
The larvÃ¦ of that very peculiar and distinct tribe, the <i>Ephemerina</i>,
appear to be intermediate between the <i>Stomapodiform</i>
and <i>Thysanuriform</i> types. Their natatory respiratory
abdominal laminÃ¦ seem copied from the former, and
their anal diverging setÃ¦ from the latter<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>. The <i>Myrmeleonina</i>,
as well in their general form as in their motions
and habits, present a most singular analogy with the tribe
of spiders, as does also in some respect that of <i>Cicindela</i>.
With regard to <i>Panorpa</i>, which Mr. MacLeay remarks
is related to <i>Myrmeleon</i><a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>, and is a most ferocious insect<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>,
as its larva has not yet been discovered, nothing certain
respecting its analogical form can be asserted; but should
it, like the male fly, represent the scorpion, both orders
of <i>Arachnida</i> will have their representatives in the class
we are considering. The <i>Corydalina</i>, as far as the larva
of <i>Hemerobius</i> instructs us, is <i>Chilopodiform</i>, but with a
tendency to the <i>Araneidiform</i> Type. The <i>Ametabola</i>
also furnish the prototype of the next tribe, the <i>Termitina</i>,
which, as is evident both from <i>Psocus</i> and <i>Termes</i>,
are perfectly <i>Anopluriform</i>. The <i>Sialina</i>, or <i>Plicipennes</i>
of Latreille, excluding <i>Trichoptera</i> Kirby, appear to me
to be intermediate between the <i>Chilopodiform</i> and <i>Stomapodiform</i>
Types, and not without some relation to the
<i>Thysanuriform</i>. Their pediform, jointed, respiratory abdominal
appendages, their head and falcate mandibles,
seem copied from the first tribe. The same appendages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
considered as organs of respiration, and their taper forks,
are moulded upon the plan of the <i>Stomapodiform Crustacea</i>,
and the long seta which terminates the abdomen is
upon the <i>Thysanuriform</i> plan<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Trichoptera.</i> The larvÃ¦ of this order appear also to
be constructed upon a double plan. The respiratory
threads observable in both the upper and under sides of
the abdomen connect it with the <i>Stomapoda</i>, and its cylindrical
elongate body with <i>Chilognathiform</i> types in the
<i>Lepidoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Lepidoptera.</i> The great majority of larvÃ¦ in this order
are <i>Chilognathiform</i>, but there are exceptions to this
remark. Those of the <i>GeometrÃ¦</i> recede from this type,
both in their motions and the distance and number of
their legs. In both these respects they represent the <i>LÃ¦modipoda</i>
in the <i>Crustacea</i><a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. Other caterpillars are <i>Onisciform</i>;
and a third sort seem to leave the <i>Annulose</i> type,
and imitate that of the <i>Mollusca</i>, and one is figured by
Madame Merian<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> which appears to tend even to the
<i>Chilopodiform</i> type.</p>

<p><i>Hymenoptera.</i> In this order the larvÃ¦ of the saw-flies,
<i>Tenthredo</i> L., are in general <i>Chilognathiform</i>, though some
are <i>Onisciform</i>, others <i>Limaciform</i>, and those of <i>Lyda</i> F.
(<i>Cephaleia</i> Jur.) and <i>Sirex</i><a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> have a <i>Vermiform</i> tendency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and are a stepping-stone to those of the rest of the order,
which are all <i>Vermiform</i> and apods.</p>

<p><i>Diptera.</i> The majority of this order may be set down
as <i>Vermiform</i>, though it is not improbable that some of
them bear an analogy to animals that appear far removed
from the <i>Annulosa</i>. Thus, the larva of <i>Stratyomis Chameleon</i>
seems to exhibit no small resemblance to some of
the <i>Polypi vaginati</i> in the <i>Acrita</i> subkingdom of Mr. W.
MacLeay<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>. That of <i>Culex</i> and some others is constructed
on a quite different type from the rest, and seems
to possess some analogy to the <i>Branchiopod Crustacea</i>.</p>

<p>Though some of these analogies are more striking than
others, yet in almost all that I have stated there is that
kind of resemblance that could not be the result of what is
called mere chance; and Mr. MacLeay, by first pointing out
this plan of the All-wise Creator, and by laying down
the doctrine of <i>analogies</i> in general, as distinguished from
<i>affinities</i> in the animal kingdom, has furnished the believer
with a new argument against those attacks of the
infidel, that would render null those proofs of the wisdom
and goodness of the Author of nature with which the animal
and vegetable creation furnish us; by affirming most
absurdly, and under the most stultifying blindness of
mind, that the <i>creatures</i> were in a manner their own <i>creators</i>,
their wants under local circumstances stimulating
them to efforts that in a long course of years produced
all the different forms and organizations that are now to
be found in our globe. The affinities and close connexion
of beings with each other, so that the ascent from low to
high is usually by the most gentle gradations, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
circumstance on which they build this strange and impious
theory. But the fact, that certain animals of one tribe
were created with a view to certain animals of another,
so as to present a striking aspect of correspondence, parallel
almost with that of type and antitype, without any
real affinity or approximation;&mdash;this triumphantly proves
a Power above and without them, who has associated
them not only in a complex chain of affinities, but has
caused them to represent and figure each other, even
when evidently far removed, so as to give a mutual correspondence
and harmony to the whole, which could be
produced only by a Being infinite in power and wisdom,
who made all things after a general preconceived plan
and system.</p>


<p>iv. We are now to consider the <i>clothing</i> with which
larvÃ¦ are furnished. Many are quite naked, and smooth
or rough only with granular elevations or tubercles orderly
arranged; but a very considerable number, especially
of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> order, are clothed with hair or
bristles of different kinds, in greater or less abundance,
and arranged in different modes; and a proportion still
smaller have their skin beset with spines or a mixture of
spines and hairs. Lyonnet found that the hairs of the
caterpillar of the great goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) were
hollow, though not to the apex: probably this is the case
with those of other larvÃ¦, as well as with their spines.
In this instance they were set, he observes, in a corneous
ring, or very short cylinder, elevated a little above the
skin. The hair passes through this ring, and appears to
be rooted in a soft integument, which clothes the skin
within, and upon which the nerves form a reticular tissue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
some of which he thinks he has even seen enter the root
of the hairs, which perhaps are organs of touch<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the pilose larvÃ¦, some, like most of those of the
smaller moths (<i>Geometra</i>, <i>Tortrix</i>, <i>Pyralis</i>, &amp;c.), have
merely a few scattered short hairs, scarcely perceptible except
through a lens: others (<i>Odenesis potatoria</i>, <i>Lasiocampa
Rubi</i>) are covered with down more or less thick: in
others (<i>Eriogaster lanestris</i>, <i>Lasiocampa Neustria</i>) the
hair is slenderer, and more like wool; the body of two species
which I purchased from the collection of Mr. Francillon
is covered with woolly hairs, so long as to give
them the appearance of a shock-dog; and Madam Merian
has figured a similar one, which she could not bring to the
perfect state<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>. The hairs of many <i>BombycidÃ¦</i>, known
commonly by the name of <i>hairy caterpillars</i>, as <i>Arctia erminea</i>,
&amp;c. are stiffer, resembling bristles; sometimes, as
in <i>Arctia chrysorhea</i>, mixed with shorter ones. The
hairs either spring immediately from the skin (<i>Noctua
Aceris</i>, <i>leporina</i>), or, as is more general, proceed only
from certain tubercular elevations, usually subhemispherical,
but sometimes conical; of which a number varying
from four to twelve are found on each segment of different
species. They seem to issue from these tubercles,
as little diverging streams from the rose of a watering-pot.
In both cases, they form a coating usually so dense as
to conceal the body, but sometimes more thinly set, and
admitting the skin to be seen more or less between them.
In a caterpillar of the beautiful <i>Arctia ocularia</i>, the hairs
are set upon tubercles alternately nearer the anterior and
posterior margin of each segment, so as to form a dense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
band, the rest being naked; and in the lovely green and
black one of <i>Saturnia Pavonia</i>, each tubercle bears but
six hairs, diverging like a star, the central one being the
longest and capitate, so that the chief part of the body
appears naked. This diverging position of the hairs is
most common in the thick-clothed larvÃ¦ also, but many
have them placed differently: thus, in those of <i>Callimorpha
Caja</i> and <i>Arctia villica</i><a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> they are all directed towards
the tail, like the quills of a porcupine: in some others
the anterior ones point towards the head: in that of
<i>Eriogaster Quercus</i> half of the tuft of hairs of each tubercle
is directed downwards, the other half upwards:
in that of <i>Arctia Salicis</i> all the hairs point downwards,
so that the belly is thickly covered, while the back is
bare. Another variation is, that the hairs of half the
tubercle are sometimes very long, while those of the
other half are very short, and even of a different colour<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>.
In the larva of Tussuck moths (<i>Laria pudibunda</i>, <i>fascelina</i>,
&amp;c.) the hairs are collected into tufts of a singular
appearance, those on the intermediate segments of the
back being quite level at the top, so as to resemble so
many brushes; while those on the first and last segments
are longer, and composed of feathered hairs converging
to a point at their extremity, like a common camel-hair-pencil<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.
This last mode of arrangement prevails also in
the larva of <i>Noctua Aceris</i>; but in this the pencils are
shorter, exactly wedge-shaped, and distinguished by another
particularity, that of springing directly from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
skin, and not from a tubercle. This is also the case with
the large caterpillars of <i>Odenesis potatoria</i>, which has a
double row of short bundles of black hairs on the back,
intermixed with larger ones: at each end of the body is
a pencil of converging hairs, and the sides are spotted
with bundles of white ones, which with longer tawny
ones are bent downwards, so as to cover the sides of the
creature<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>. Some have the anterior aigrettes disposed like
the arms of a cross, of which the body of the caterpillar
is the stem<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>. But not only is there considerable variety
in the general arrangement of the hairs that clothe our
little larvÃ¦, the hairs themselves differ much in their kind
and structure, of which I will now, before I proceed to
consider spines, give you some account. Several of them
are feathered like the plumes of a bird: this is the case
with those of <i>Morpho Idomeneus</i>, on each segment of the
body of which are three blue tubercles, like so many little
turquois beads, from each of which proceeds a long black
plume<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>. Other hairs terminate in a club; those of the
larva of <i>Noctua Alni</i>, a specimen of which I possess taken
in England, are flat and incrassated at the apex, something
like the antennÃ¦ of some <i>SphingidÃ¦</i>. Mad. Merian
has figured the caterpillar of another moth which feeds
upon the Papaw-tree (<i>Carica Papaya</i>) with similar hairs<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.
But the most remarkable larva for the shape of its hairs
is that of <i>Anthrenus MusÃ¦orum</i>, the little pest of our cabinets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
which I noticed in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>. All the hairs
of its body are rough with minute points; but those of
six diverging long tufts or aigrettes, laid obliquely on
the anal extremity of the body, which the animal when
alarmed erects as a porcupine does its quills, are of a
most singular structure: every hair is composed of a series
of little conical pieces, placed end to end, the point
of which is directed towards the origin of each hair, which
is terminated at the other extremity by a long and large
conical mass, resembling somewhat the head of a pike<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the one lately mentioned, other caterpillars
are rendered striking by the brilliant colour of the tubercles
from which their hairs emerge. A remarkable instance
of this is the thick large caterpillar of a Bombyx,
which feeds upon the <i>Psidium pyriferum</i>, or white Guava,
figured by Madame Merian. This caterpillar, which is
white, with transverse black stripes, and which has two
singular long converging curved bunches of hairs near
the tail, is splendidly adorned on each side with fifty red
tubercles, shining like coral, from which proceed six or
seven long diverging hairs. Leeuwenhoeck took these
tubercles for eyes<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. Another figured by the same lady,
who mistakes it, with her usual inaccuracy, for the larva
of a <i>LygÃ¦us</i> F., and which seems by her description to
be between the <i>onisciform</i> and <i>limaciform</i> types, has the
apparently fleshy mamillÃ¦ that project from its sides and
back crowned with little hairy red globes, which give the
animal a most singular and unique appearance<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>. Having
thus described some of the principal modes in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the All-wise Creator has decked and defended these
creatures with <i>hairs</i>, I shall next give you a short account
of the <i>spines</i> with which he has armed others.
The spinous larvÃ¦ are principally <i>lepidopterous</i>, and more
particularly conspicuous in some tribes of the genus <i>Papilio</i>
L., though some saw-flies and <i>Diptera</i> are also distinguished
by them. <i>Vanessa Io</i><a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>, <i>Atalanta</i> and <i>Urtica</i>,
<i>Argynnis Paphia</i>, <i>Urania Leilus</i>, and many other Butterflies,
&amp;c. are clothed with long sharp points, which
claim the denomination of spines, rather than that of
hairs or bristles; being horny and hard, and so stiff at
the point as readily to pierce the skin. Those of the last-mentioned
species, Madame Merian says, are as stiff as
iron-wire<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>. They are sometimes entirely <i>simple</i>, and
look like spikes rather than spines, as in the caterpillar
of <i>Nymphalis Amphinome</i> and <i>Morpho Menelaus</i><a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>; but
ordinarily they are beset with <i>hairs</i>, or more commonly
with shorter spines, which often give them the appearance
of plumes, as in <i>Urania Leilus</i> just mentioned: sometimes
these lateral spines are so long as to have the appearance
of a branch of a tree; this is strikingly the case with
a small caterpillar which Captain Hancock brought from
Brazil; its body is so thickly planted with spines of this
description, that it absolutely wears the appearance of
a forest or thicket in miniature. A singular circumstance
attends the spines of this species: in many cases
a smaller and very slender hair-like spine issues from
them, resembling a sting; and this accounts for an observation
of Abbott's, that many American caterpillars
<i>sting</i> like a nettle, raising little white blisters on the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
when accidentally or slightly touched<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>. Lewin has described
the caterpillar of a moth found in New Holland,
which he names <i>Bombyx vulnerans</i>, that, like these Americans,
has also the power of wounding, but in a different
way. It darts out, he says, when alarmed by the approach
of any thing, from as many knobs or protuberances
in its back eight bunches of little stings, with
which it inflicts a very painful and venomous wound<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>.
The caterpillar of <i>Papilio Protesilaus</i> F., if Madame Merian's
account and figure of it are correct, has its body
armed with hairy spines, the extreme point of which is
surmounted by a star-shaped appendage<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>. Those of a
few saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo Pruni</i> L.), and another figured
by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>, are covered with a little forest of spines
without lateral branches, but divided into a fork at the
apex. Some spines are merely rough, with very short
points, as those round the head, which give so terrific an
appearance to the caterpillar of the <i>Bombyx regalis</i>, of
some proceedings of which I gave you an account in one
of my former letters<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>.</p>

<p>I must now say something upon the <i>arrangement</i> of
these spines. Though in a few instances so thickly set
as entirely to conceal the body of the animal, as in the
case of the Brazil one lately mentioned, yet generally
speaking, even when they are most numerous, they permit
the skin to be distinctly seen. Their arrangement
is various, though always orderly: in the majority they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
are planted singly, but in some caterpillars in bundles.
In that of <i>Saturnia Io</i>, on each segment there are six bundles
of longish, quill-shaped, sharp, slender, diverging
spines, which also appear to sheath aculei. Madame
Merian has figured this larva, or one very near it, as the
grub of a <i>Euglossa</i><a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>, with which, though she affirms she
traced it to the fly, it can have no connection. With regard
to <i>number</i>, some larvÃ¦ have only four spines on
each segment; others five, others again six, and others
seven, or even eight: they are planted on the sides and
back only, never on the belly. They are often more numerous
on the intermediate than on the anterior and
posterior segments; but sometimes the reverse of this
takes place; in that of <i>Attacus ErythrinÃ¦</i> only the head
and tail are armed with spines, the rest of the body being
without any<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>; and in that of <i>Morpho Teucer</i> there is
only a single spine on the four intermediate segments<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>.
They are usually all nearly of equal length; but in some
cases those of the head and tail are much longer than
the rest, and remarkably so in the caterpillar of <i>Urania
Leilus</i>, also beautifully plumose, and gracefully waved<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.
Those in the second and third segments are much longer
than any of the rest in that of <i>Bombyx regalis</i>; which
circumstance gives it the terrific appearance lately alluded
to. In the family to which <i>Argynnis Paphia</i> belongs,
the larva is adorned with two on the back of the
first segment twice as long as the rest, and resembling
at first sight two antennÃ¦.</p>

<p>The spines, as well as the hairs of the new skin, are
concealed under the old one, and not incased in its spines;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
but Bonnet ascertained, that if cut off very closely, the
larva sometimes died in consequence, whilst no such result
followed a similar operation on hairy larvÃ¦. We
learn from Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>, that some spinous larvÃ¦ of saw-flies
(<i>Tenthredo</i> L.) lose their spines at the last change of
their skin; and from Madame Merian, that that of <i>Attacus
ErythrinÃ¦</i> before mentioned loses also at the same
period the six tremendous black spikes that arm its black
and yellow larvÃ¦. The grubs of ants that are destined
to pass the winter in the larva state are hairy, but are not
so in summer<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>. The spines found in the grubs of some
gad-flies (<i>&#338;strus</i> L.) are of a different kind from those
above described, being very minute triangular flat plates,
arranged in different and contrary directions<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>, and serving
the insect merely to change its place and fix itself<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.</p>

<p>Two other kinds of clothing, if so they may be called,
neither coming under the description of <i>hairs</i> nor <i>spines</i>,
are found in some other larvÃ¦, not only amongst the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
but also in some of the other orders. <i>Nymphalis
Populi</i> and others of the same family have larvÃ¦
furnished on the back of each segment with cylindricoconical
processes of a fleshy substance, obtuse at the apex
and surrounded with capitate hairs. In that of <i>N. Sybilla</i>,
which has on each segment two fleshy protuberances,
they are bifurcate or trifurcate, and also encircled
at the base with a hairy tuft<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>. Others, as those of
<i>MelitÃ¦a Artemis</i>, <i>Cynthia</i>, &amp;c. have each segment beset
on the back with from seven to nine fleshy, pubescent,
wedge-shaped protuberances; two larger ones projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
over the head. Under this head, too, may be noticed,
the glutinous secretion which clothes the grub of <i>Cionus
ScrophulariÃ¦</i>, a little weevil; and of <i>Tenthredo Cerasi</i> L.
a saw-fly, and that waxy or powdery substance which
transpires through the skin of the larvÃ¦ of several <i>Aphides</i>,
<i>Chermes</i>, <i>Cocci</i>, <i>Hylotoma ovata</i> F., &amp;c. The <i>Aphis</i>,
whose extensive ravages of our apple-trees (<i>A. lanata</i>)
were before described to you<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>, is covered and quite concealed
by this kind of substance, so that the crevices in
the bark which they inhabit look as if they were filled,
not with animals, but with cotton. The insect, also,
that forms those curious galls produced upon the spruce
fir, and which imitate its cones (<i>Chermes Abietis</i> L., <i>Aphis</i>
De Geer) secretes a similar substance. In these and
other cases of the same kind, this matter seems to be, if
I may so speak, wire-drawn through numerous pores in
certain oval plates in the skin, more depressed than the
rest of the back, arranged regularly upon the segments,
and exhibiting minute tuberosities. When young, these
animals have more of this secretion than when more advanced:
it then hangs from their anal extremity in
locks<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>.</p>

<p>But the insects most remarkable for a covering of this
nature are those <i>CoccidÃ¦</i> of which Bosc has made a genus
under the name of <i>Dorthesia</i>. De Geer is the first
author that notices them, and has given a description
and figure of one species under the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
<i>Coccus floccosus</i><a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>. It was discovered by Modeer upon some sere
fir-leaves in a thick bed of moss. Panzer has figured a
second found upon <i>Geranium sanguineum</i>, which from
the figure appears distinct from De Geer's, under the
name of <i>Coccus dubius</i><a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>. Fabricius regards this as synonymous
with the <i>Dorthesia characias</i> of Bosc, inhabiting
<i>Euphorbia characias</i> in South Europe<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. Olivier found
a species upon the bramble<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>. I once took one, which
appears to differ in some respects from the preceding species,
upon <i>Melampyrum cristatum</i>, and our indefatigable
friend Mr. Sheppard has sent me another, on what plant
found I do not remember, which does not agree with any
that I have mentioned. The body of the animals of this
genus is covered by a number of cottony or waxy laminÃ¦
which partly cover each other, and are arranged usually
in a triple series: in De Geer's figure the series appears
quadruple, the lateral ones being placed obliquely. The
anterior one in my specimen covered the head, and they
are all canaliculate. Above the anus are four diverging
ones: the whole are of the most dazzling whiteness.
When these laminÃ¦ are removed, the body appears divided
into segments.</p>

<p>With respect to those larvÃ¦ which imitate slugs by the
viscid covering that besmears them and issues from their
pores, we learn from Professor Peck that this exudation
takes place as soon as they are hatched; that the animal
retains its humidity although exposed to the fiercest heat
of the sun, and that at the last moult the skin becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
quite clean, and free from all viscidity<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>. It is probable
that the other limaciform larvÃ¦ are similarly circumstanced.
Madame Merian has figured an <i>onisciform</i> one,
the legs of which, she says, are covered with a viscid skin:
this produced a <i>Noctua</i>. Those of <i>Papilio Anchises</i> also
are slimy, and adhere to each other<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>.</p>


<p>v. Amongst other qualities which attach to larvÃ¦, we
must not omit to say something concerning their <i>Colour</i>.
For though those which live in darkness, in the earth,
in wood, in fruits, &amp;c. are, with few exceptions<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>, of an
uniform whitish colour, yet such as are exposed to the
influence of the light are usually adorned with a vast variety
of tints, sometimes the most vivid that can be imagined.
That the white colour of the former may be attributed
to the absence of light is proved by an experiment
of M. Dorthes, who having forced some to live under
glasses, exposed to the light, found that they gradually
became brown<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>. To attempt any classification of
coloured larvÃ¦ would be in vain, since they are tinged
with almost every possible shade that can be conceived,
of many of which it would be difficult to find examples
elsewhere; and infinitely diversified as to the arrangement
and figure of their multiform markings and spots. A few
general remarks, therefore, are all that you will expect
on this head. Many are of one uniform colour; while a
variety of tints, very different, and very vivid and distinct,
ornament others. Sometimes they are distributed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
longitudinal rays or bands, at others in transverse ones.
Sometimes they are waved or spotted, regularly or irregularly;
at others they are sprinkled in dots, or minute
streaks, in every possible way. Various larvÃ¦ are of the
colour of the plant on which they feed, whence they are
with difficulty discovered by their enemies. Thus, a large
proportion of <i>Lepidoptera</i> are green of different shades,
sometimes beautifully contrasted with black bands; a circumstance
which renders the caterpillars of two of our
finest insects of this order as lovely as the fly: I mean
that of <i>Papilio Machaon</i> and <i>Saturnia Pavonia</i>. Very
frequently the larvÃ¦ of quite different species resemble
each other so exactly, in colour as well as shape, as
scarcely to be distinguishable: this sometimes takes
place even where they belong to different genera, as in
those of <i>Bombyx versicolor</i> a moth, and <i>Smerinthus Populi</i>
a hawk-moth. And it sometimes happens, very fortunately
for distinguishing allied species, that where the
perfect insects very nearly resemble each other, the larvÃ¦
are altogether dissimilar. Thus, the female of <i>Pieris
RapÃ¦</i> is so much like the same sex of <i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>,
that it might be taken for a variety of it, did not the
green caterpillar of the one, and the spotted one of the
other, evince the complete distinction of these butterflies.
<i>Noctua Lactuca</i>, <i>N. umbratica</i>, and several other species
of the same tribe, which includes <i>N. Absinthii</i>, <i>Verbasci</i>,
<i>ChamomillÃ¦</i>, <i>Abrotani</i>, are so extremely alike, that the
most practised eye can scarcely discover a shade of difference
between them, though their larvÃ¦ in colour and
markings are constantly distinct<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>. The markings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
species belonging to the same family are usually different;
but in some cases the latter may be prejudged from
the former. The larvÃ¦ of many of the genus <i>Sphinx</i> L.,
for example, have their sides marked by oblique streaks
running from the back in a direction towards the head;
and by this last circumstance they are distinguished from
those of <i>Bombyx versicolor</i>, <i>Attacus Tau</i>, and others of
the same tribe, which have also lateral oblique striÃ¦, but
running from the back towards the tail<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>. The colours
of individual larvÃ¦ of the same species are usually alike,
but in <i>Sphinx Elpenor</i> and some others they vary exceedingly.
Many, like those of <i>Lasiocampa Rubi</i>, <i>Saturnia
minor</i>, &amp;c., are of one colour when first disclosed, and
assume others quite different in riper age. Just previously
to <i>changing their skin</i>, the tints of most larvÃ¦ become
as dull and obscure, as they are fresh and vivid when
the change has fully taken place; and in some instances
the new skin is quite differently marked from the old one.
This is remarkably the case with the last skin of some of
the larvÃ¦ of the genus <i>Tenthredo</i> L., which is entirely
different from all the preceding ones. As people when
they advance far in years usually become more simple in
their dress than when they were young, so the larvÃ¦ in
question change an agreeably variegated skin for one of
a uniform and less brilliant colour<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>. Madame Merian
has observed with respect to <i>Attacus ErythrinÃ¦</i>, that its
caterpillar is at first yellowish, with nine black striÃ¦
on each side: when arrived at one third of its size,
they become orange; the striÃ¦ are obliterated, and in
their place a round black spot appears on each of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
eight intermediate segments<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>. Mr. Sheppard has remarked
to me, that the skin of that of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i>,
after being under ground four days, was changed from a
vivid green to a dull red. Very rarely, however, it becomes
of a more brilliant hue just before entering the
pupa state: thus, that of another hawk-moth (<i>Smerinthus
TiliÃ¦</i>) changes to a bright violet; and the yellow hairs
of that of <i>Laria pudibunda</i> then become of a lovely rose
colour. And here I may observe, that the hairs and
spines also, of larvÃ¦, vary greatly in colour. They are to
be met with brown, black, red, yellow, violet, white, &amp;c.
De Geer found, that in the larva of <i>Cimbex nitens</i> the
two sides of the body were of a different colour, the
left being of a deep green, whilst the right side and the
rest of the body were paler<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>; but as he saw only a single
individual, this was probably an accidental circumstance.
Though the caterpillars, as I lately said, of one of the
most beautiful butterflies and moths that inhabit Britain
contend with the perfect insect in loveliness, yet in general
no judgement can be formed of the beauty of the future
fly from the colour of the larva; and the young Aurelian
must not flatter himself always with the hope, because
the caterpillar excites admiration by its colours and
their arrangement, that the butterfly or moth it is to produce
will do the same; nor ought he to despise and overlook
a sombre or plain-coloured individual of the former,
under the idea that it will produce one equally plain of
the latter, for it often happens that the splendid caterpillar
gives a plain butterfly or moth, and <i>vice versÃ¢</i>.
De Geer, however, gives us two instances of conformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
between the colours of the caterpillar and those of the
future moth; the one is that of the common currant-moth
(<i>PhalÃ¦na G. grossulariata</i> L.), the caterpillar of
which is white, ornamented with several black spots varying
in size. At the two extremities it is yellowish, with
a longitudinal ray of the same colour on each side, the
head and legs being black. These colours are all to be
found in the fly, the ground of its wings being white ornamented
with many black spots of different sizes. Its
upper wings are traversed by a yellowish band; and
towards their base is a spot of the same colour. Its body
is yellowish, with black spots; but the head and legs are
black<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>. The other is that of a green caterpillar, which
gives a green moth, figured by Reaumur (<i>Pyralis prasinaria</i> Fab.)<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>.
Sometimes, also, the sex of the future perfect
insect may be predicted from the colour it exhibits in
its first state: thus, the brown caterpillars of <i>Noctua Pronuba</i>
produce males, and the green ones females<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>. The
sexes, also, of <i>N. exoleta</i> and <i>PersicariÃ¦</i> differ in that
state.</p>


<p>vi. To the full account of the <i>Food</i> of insects given in
a former letter<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>, which had reference chiefly to their
larva state, it is only necessary in this place to add a few
particulars not there noticed. Many larvÃ¦ when first
excluded, as those of <i>Pieris CratÃ¦gi</i>, &amp;c. devour the
shells of the eggs from which they have proceeded<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
others (<i>Cerura Vinula</i>, <i>Sphinx EuphorbiÃ¦</i>, <i>Noctua Verbasci</i>),
though their usual food is of a vegetable nature,
eat with great apparent satisfaction the skins which they
cast from time to time, not leaving even the horny legs.
This strange repast seems even a stimulating dainty,
which speedily restores them to vigour, after the painful
operation by which they are supplied with it. Under
this head it will not be out of place to mention, that some
larvÃ¦ of insects, which feed only on the juices of animals,
or the nectar and ambrosia of flowers, have no anal passage,
and of course no feces. This is said to be the case
with the grubs of bees, wasps, the larvÃ¦ of <i>Myrmeleon</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>


<p>vii. You will require no stimulus to induce you to attend
to the subject I am next going to enter upon,&mdash;the
<i>Moulting</i>, namely, of LarvÃ¦; or their changes of skin.
This, indeed, is a subject so replete with interest, and
which so fully displays the power, wisdom, and goodness
of the Creator, affording at the same time such large occasion
for nice investigation, that a pious and inquisitive
mind like yours cannot but be taken with it. In the
higher orders of animals, though the <i>hairs</i> of quadrupeds
and the <i>feathers</i> of birds are in many cases annually
renewed, the change, or scaling and increment of the
<i>skin</i>, is gradual and imperceptible; no simultaneous rejection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of it, in which it is stripped off by the animal itself
like a worn shirt, being observable, till you descend in
the scale to the Serpent tribe<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>, which at certain periods
disengage themselves from their old integument, and start
forth with that new and deadly beauty so finely described
by the Mantuan bard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So from his den, the winter slept away,<br /></span>

<span class="i42"><span class="smcap">Pitt.</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In these the new skin, I imagine, is formed under the
old from the <i>rete mucosum</i>; but in <i>insects</i>, as I formerly
stated<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>, since the time of Swammerdam it has generally
been believed by entomologists, that the larva includes a
series of cases or envelopes, one within the other, containing
in the centre the germe of the future perfect insect,
whose development and final exclusion take place only
when these cases have been successively cast off. This
hypothesis, as was explained to you on a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>,
has been controverted by a late writer, Dr. Herold; who
affirms that the skins of caterpillars are also successively
produced out of the <i>rete mucosum</i>. I have however, I
hope, satisfied you that the old system is most consonant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
to nature and probability: but as we are now to enter
at large upon the <i>Moults</i> of insects, it will not be without
use if I add a few additional reasons which seem to me
still further to prove the correctness of Swammerdam's
system, as far as it relates to that subject. With regard
to the mere formation of the skin from the <i>rete mucosum</i>,
were this the whole question few would hesitate to adopt
the sentiments of M. Herold; but when we come to consider
further&mdash;that the number of moults of individuals
of the <i>same</i> species is always the same, and that it varies
in <i>different</i> species, and takes place at certain periods,&mdash;we
begin to suspect that something more than the mere
formation of a new skin upon an old one being cast is to
be accounted for; and that the law which prescribes its
own definite number of skins to each species, must begin
to act in the primordial formation of the larva. Again,
the <i>hairs</i> observable in the higher animals do not take
their origin from the epidermis solely, but are planted
below it in the <i>rete mucosum</i>, or deeper<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>; so that the
change of skin does not affect them; but in the larvÃ¦ of
insects they are a continuation of that integument, since,
when the moult takes place, they always remain on the
rejected skin<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>: this is the case, also, even with spines.
If you shave a caterpillar ready to change its skin, either
partially or generally, you will find that the parts in the
new skin that correspond with those that are denuded,
are equally hairy with those that were not<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>; and if
you pay attention to the new-clad animal, you will find
further, that the hairs never grow after a moult. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
hence it follows, that the <i>hairs</i> have their place and take
their whole growth between the new skin and the old<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>.
Whether the <i>spines</i>, simple or compound, lately described
to you, that arm some larvÃ¦ are similarly circumstanced,
seems not as yet to have been ascertained; but as the
spinous ones of certain <i>Tenthredines</i> L. and <i>Lepidoptera</i>
at their last moult have no spines, the presumption is,
that, whether incased or not, they are mere appendages
of the skin on which they appear. A new set of hairs,
therefore, and probably of spines in spinous larvÃ¦, accompanying
each skin, and these varying very much in
size, composition, &amp;c. though a new membrane may be
admitted to be formed from an action in the <i>rete mucosum</i>
without a pre-existent germe of it, it seems not easy to
conceive how these hairs and spines can spring up and
grow there, each according to a certain law, without existing
previously as a kind of <i>corculum</i> or <i>punctum saliens</i>;
and that the germes of the tubercles, in which the hairs
are so generally planted, according to a certain arrangement
and in a given number, should also pre-exist, seems
most consonant to reason. These and the several skins may
all co-exist in their primordial germes, and remain beyond
the discovery of our highest powers of assisted vision,
till a certain period when they may first enter the
range of the microscope-aided eye. It does not therefore
follow, because these <i>primordia semina rerum</i> are not
discoverable, that therefore they may not exist. Our
faculties and organs are too limited and of too little power
to enable us to see the essences of being.</p>

<p>Upon the supposition that the hypothesis of Swammerdam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
is the true one, we may imagine that the envelope
that lies within all the rest is that which covers the
insect in its pupa state. Above this are placed several
others, which successively become external integuments.
These changes or casting of the skin in larvÃ¦, analogous,
as before observed, to that of serpents, are familiar to
every breeder of silk-worms, in which <i>four</i> such changes
occur: the first at the end of about <i>twelve</i> days from its
birth, and the three next each at the end of <i>half</i> that time
from the moulting which preceded it. With some exceptions<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>,
similar changes of the skin take place in all
larvÃ¦, not however in the same number and at the same
periods. Most indeed undergo this operation only three
or four times; but there are some that moult oftener,
from five up to eight (<i>Arctia villica</i>), nine (<i>Callimorpha
Dominula</i>), or even ten times; for so often, M. Cuvier
informs us, the caterpillar of the tiger-moth (<i>Callimorpha
Caja</i>) casts its exuviÃ¦. It has been observed that the
caterpillars of the day-flying <i>Lepidoptera</i> (<i>Papilio</i> L.)
usually change only <i>three</i> times, while those of the night-flying
ones (<i>PhalÃ¦na</i> L.) change <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>. The periods
that intervene between each change depend upon the
length of the insect's existence in the larva state. In
those which live only a few weeks or months, they are
from eight to twenty days; while in those that live more
than a year, as the cockchafer, &amp;c. they are probably
proportionably longer: though we know very little with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
regard to the moult of any insects besides the <i>Lepidoptera</i>.</p>

<p>A day or two previously to each change of its skin,
the larva ceases eating altogether; it becomes languid
and feeble, its beautiful colours fade, and it seeks for a
retreat in which it can undergo this important and sometimes
dangerous and even fatal operation in security.
Here, either fixing itself by its legs to the surface on
which it rests, or, as is the case with many caterpillars,
by its prolegs, to a slight web spun for this purpose, it
turns and twists its body in various directions, and alternately
swells and contracts its different segments. The
object of these motions and contortions seems to be, to
separate the exterior skin, now become dry and rigid,
from the new one just below it. After continuing these
operations for some hours, resting at intervals without
motion, as if exhausted by their violence, the critical moment
arrives: the skin splits in the back, in consequence
of the still more violent swelling of the second or
third segment: the opening thus made is speedily increased
by a succession of swellings and contractions of
the remaining segments: even the head itself often divides
into three triangular pieces, and the inclosed larva
by degrees withdraws itself wholly from its old skin.
All larvÃ¦, however, do not force their way through this
skin in precisely the same place. Thus, those of the hawthorn
butterfly (<i>Pieris CratÃ¦gi</i>), according to Bonnet<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
make their way out by forcing off what may be called their
skull, or the horny part of their head, without splitting the
skin, which remains entire; others have been observed
to make their way out at the side and the belly. Reaumur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
noticed the larva of <i>ZygÃ¦na FilipendulÃ¦</i>, previously
to its last moult, actually biting off and detaching several
portions of its old skin; and before this, drops of a fluid
resembling water were seen to exude from it<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>.</p>

<p>The skin when cast is often so entire, that it might be
mistaken for the larva itself; comprising not only the
covering of the main trunk with the hairs which clothed
it, but of the very skull, eyes, antennÃ¦, palpi, jaws, and
legs; which, if examined from within, are now found to
be hollow, and to have incased, like so many sheaths,
similar parts in the new skin. That the feet of the newly-coated
larva were actually sheathed, as fingers in a glove,
in the same parts of the exuviÃ¦, may be proved by a
very simple experiment: if a leg of one just ready to
cast its skin be cut off, the same limb will be found mutilated
when that change has ensued. The anal horns,
also, of the larvÃ¦ of the hawk-moth (<i>Sphinx</i> L.) and other
similar protuberances, are incased in each other in like
manner; but hairs are laid flat between the two skins,
and contribute considerably towards their more easy separation.
Thus, if you saved the skins cast by the larva
of <i>Callimorpha Caja</i>, for instance, you would appear to
have ten different specimens of caterpillars, furnished
with every external necessary part, and differing only in
size, and the colour perhaps of the hairs, and all representing
the same individual.</p>

<p>But further changes than this take place. Swammerdam
says, speaking of the moult of the grub of <i>Oryctes
nasicornis</i>, a beetle common in Holland, but not satisfactorily
ascertained to inhabit Britain, "Nothing in all
nature is in my opinion a more wonderful sight than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
change of skin in these and other the like worms. This
matter, therefore, deserves the greatest consideration,
and is worthy to be called a specimen of nature's miracles;
for it is not the external skin only that these worms
cast, like serpents, but the throat and a part of the stomach,
and even the inward surface of the great gut,
change their skin at the same time. But this is not the
whole of these wonders; for at the same time some hundreds
of pulmonary pipes within the body of the worm
cast also each its delicate and tender skin. These several
skins are afterwards collected into eighteen thicker,
and, as it were, compounded ropes, nine on each side of
the body, which, when the skin is cast, slip gently and
by degrees from within the body through the eighteen
apertures or orifices of the pulmonary tubes before described,
having their tops or ends directed upwards
towards the head. Two other branches of the pulmonary
pipes that are smaller, and have no points of respiration,
cast a skin likewise." ... "If any one separates
the cast little ropes or congeries of the pulmonary pipes
with a fine needle, he will very distinctly see the branches
and ramifications of these several pipes, and also their
annular composition<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>."&mdash;Bonnet makes a similar observation
with regard to <i>caterpillars</i>; but he appears to have
observed it more particularly, at least the change of the
intestines, previously to the metamorphosis of the insect,
when he says with the excrements it casts the inner skin
of the stomach and viscera<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>. Both these great men appear
to have recorded the result of their own actual observations
with regard to the proceedings of two very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
kinds of insects; the one the grub of a beetle, and
the other the caterpillars of <i>Lepidoptera</i>. The account of
the former is given quite in detail, as that of a person who
is describing what he has actually <i>seen</i>: yet by a later and
very able physiologist, Dr. Herold, it is affirmed that the
inner skin of the intestinal canal is never cast, that canal
constantly retaining its two skins. He further affirms, that
they are only the <i>large</i> trunks of the TracheÃ¦ that cast
their skins, none being detached from their <i>smaller</i> ramifications<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>.
When men so eminent for their anatomical
skill and nicety, and for their depth and acumen, disagree,
the question must be regarded as undecided till
further observations throw sufficient weight into one scale
or the other.</p>

<p>The larva which has undergone this painful process is
at first extremely weak: all its parts are soft and tender;
even the corneous ones, as the head and the legs, are then
scarcely more than membranous, and are all bathed with
a fluid, which, before the moult, intervenes between the
two skins, and facilitates their separation<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>: and it is
only after some <i>hours</i>, or in some cases even <i>days</i>, during
which it lies without motion, that this humidity evaporates,
all its parts become consolidated, and it recovers
its strength sufficiently to betake itself to its wonted
food. Its colour, too, is usually at first much paler than
before, and its markings indistinct, until their tints have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
been enlivened by exposure to the air, when they become
more fresh, vivid, and beautiful to appearance than ever.
When a few meals have invigorated its languid powers,
the renovated animal makes up for its long abstinence
by eating with double voracity.
.
A similar preparatory fast, and succeeding state of
debility, accompany every change of the larva's skin.
Each time except the last, the old skin is succeeded by
a new one, with few exceptions, similar to the one it has
discarded. Previously to the final change, which discloses
the pupa, it quits the plant or tree on which it had lived,
and appears to be quite unsettled, wandering about and
crossing the paths and roads, as if in quest of some new
dwelling. It now abstains from food for a longer time
than before a common moult, empties itself copiously,
and as I have just said, if Swammerdam and Bonnet are
to be depended upon, casts the skin that lines the stomach
and intestines, as well as that of the TracheÃ¦.</p>

<p>I have observed above, that all larvÃ¦, with few exceptions,
change their skins in the manner that I have described.
These exceptions are principally found in the
order <i>Diptera</i>, of which those of the Linnean genera
<i>Musca</i>, <i>&#338;strus</i>, and probably all that, like the maggot
of the common flesh-fly, have membranous contractile
heads, never change their skin at all, not even preparatory
to their becoming pupÃ¦. The skin of the pupa,
though often differing greatly in shape from that of the
larva, is the same which has covered this last from its
birth, only modified in figure by the internal changes that
have taken place, and to which its membranous texture
readily accommodates itself. The larvÃ¦ of the Dipterous
genera <i>Tipula</i>, <i>Culex</i>, and those which have corneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
heads, like other larvÃ¦ change their skins several
times previously to becoming pupÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>. The grubs, also,
of bees, wasps, ants? and probably many other <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
do not change their skin till they assume the pupa,
nor the larva of the female <i>Coccus</i><a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>.</p>

<p>If you feel disposed to investigate the reasons of that
law of the Creator which has ordained that the skins of
the higher animals shall be daily, and imperceptibly, and
as it were piece by piece renewed, while those of insects
are cast periodically and simultaneously,&mdash;the proximate
cause must be sought for in the nature of the two kinds
of skin, the one being more pliable and admitting a
greater degree of tension than the other, and being so
constructed as to scale off more readily. If, ascending
higher, you wish to know why the skins of insects are so
differently circumstanced from our own, the most apparent
reason is, to accommodate the skin to the very rapid
growth of these animals, which a gradual and slower
change would have impeded too much, or the skin have
suffered constant dilapidation and injury; therefore their
Beneficent Creator has furnished them with one which
will stretch to a certain point, and during a certain period,
and then yield to the efforts of the inclosed animal, and
be thrown aside as a garment that no longer fits the
wearer.</p>


<p>viii. And this leads me to a subject to which I am desirous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
now to bespeak your attention,&mdash;the <i>Growth</i>, I
mean, and size of Insects in this state. As to <i>size</i>, larvÃ¦
differ as much as insects in their perfect state: these last,
however, never grow after their exclusion from the pupa,
while larvÃ¦ increase in bulk in a proportion, and often with
a rapidity, almost without a parallel in the other tribes of
animals. Thus Lyonnet found, that the caterpillar of
the great goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i> F.) after having
attained its full growth is at least 72,000 times heavier
than when it was first excluded from the egg<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>; and of
course had increased in size in the same proportion.
Connected with the size of larvÃ¦, is the mode in which
their accretion takes place. This, with respect to the
more solid parts, as the head, legs, &amp;c., is not, as in other
animals, by gradual and imperceptible degrees, but suddenly
and at stated intervals. Between the assumption
of a new skin and the deposition of an old one, no increase
of size takes place in these parts, while the rest of
the body grows and extends itself, till, becoming too big
for these solid parts, nature restores the equilibrium between
them by a fresh moult<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>, in which the augmentation
of bulk, especially in these parts, is so great, that we
can scarcely credit the possibility of its being cased in so
small an envelope. Malpighi declares, that the head of
a silk-worm that has recently cast its skin is four times
larger than before the change<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>. It is very probable,
also, that when the outer skin becomes rigid, it confines
the body of the larva within a smaller compass than it
would expand to if unconfined, so that, when this compression
is removed, the soft and elastic new integument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
immediately swells out, and the animal appears all
at once much larger than it was before the moult. In
fact, the proximate cause of the rupture and rejection of
the old skin is the expansion of the included body, which
at length becomes so distended as to split its envelope,
aided, indeed, as before described, by the contortions of
the creature itself.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ most notorious for the <i>rapidity</i> of their
growth are those of <i>Musca carnaria</i> and other flesh-flies:
some of which Redi found to become from 140 to more
than 200 times heavier in twenty-four hours<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>: an increase
of weight and size in so short a time truly prodigious,
but essential for the end of their creation&mdash;the rapid removal
of dead and putrescent animal matter. As the
skins of these larvÃ¦ are never changed, we may conclude,
if the cause of the change of skin in other larvÃ¦ above
surmised be accurate, that their skins are more contractile
and capable of a greater degree of tension than those
of larvÃ¦ that are subject to moulting. And two peculiarities
observable in them confirm this idea: in the first
place, their head is not hard and corneous, as that of
the others, but capable of being shortened or lengthened;
and in the next, their breathing-pores are not in the sides,
but at the extremities of the body, while in the <i>moulting</i>
larvÃ¦ there are two in almost every segment, which must
form so many callous points that impede the stretching
of the skin to the utmost. The hairs, spines, and tubercles,
that are so often found on caterpillars, must also
form so many points of resistance that prevent that full
extension of the integument which it might otherwise
admit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>There is not always that proportion between the size
of larvÃ¦ and of the insects that proceed from them that
might have been supposed, some small larvÃ¦ often producing
perfect insects larger than some of those proceeding
from such as are of greater size.</p>


<p>ix. As insects often live longest in the state we are
treating of, I shall say something next upon the <i>age</i> of
larvÃ¦, or the period intervening between their exclusion
from the egg and their becoming pupÃ¦. This is exceedingly
various, but in every case nicely adapted to their
several functions and modes of life. The grubs of the
flesh-fly have attained their full growth, and are ready to
become pupÃ¦, in <i>six</i> or <i>seven</i> days; the caterpillar of <i>Argynnis
Paphia</i>, a butterfly, in <i>fourteen</i> days; the larvÃ¦ of
bees in <i>twenty</i> days; while those of the great goat-moth
(<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) and of the cockchafer (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>)
live <i>three</i> years, or at least survive three winters, before
the same change. That of another lamellicorn beetle
(<i>Oryctes nasicornis</i> F.) is said to be extended to <i>four</i> or
<i>five</i>; that of the wire-worm (<i>Elater segetum</i>) to <i>five</i>.
That of the stag-beetle (<i>Lucanus Cervus</i>) is affirmed by
RÃ¶sel to be extended to <i>six</i> years; but the most remarkable
instance of insect longevity is recorded by Mr. Marsham
in the <i>Linnean Transactions</i><a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>. A specimen of <i>Buprestis
splendida</i>, a beautiful beetle never before found in
this country, made its way out of a deal desk in an office
in London in the beginning of the year 1810, which had
been fixed there in the year 1788 or 1789; so that according
to every appearance it had existed in this desk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
more than twenty years. Ample allowance being made
for its life as a pupa, we may conclude that it had existed
as a larva at least half the above period. The grubs of
the species of the genus <i>Cynips</i> L. attain their full size
in a short time; but they afterwards remain five or six
months in the gall before they become pupÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>.</p>

<p>With few exceptions it may be laid down, that those
larvÃ¦ which live on dead animals, in fungi, in dung, and
in similar substances, are of the shortest duration in this
state; and that those which live under the earth, on the
roots of grass, &amp;c. and in wood, the longest: the former
becoming pupÃ¦ in a few days or weeks, the latter requiring
several months, or even years, to bring them to maturity.
The larvÃ¦ which live on the leaves of plants
seem to attain a middle term between the one and the
other,&mdash;seldom shorter than a few weeks, and rarely
longer than seven or eight months. Aquatic larvÃ¦ appear
to be subject to no general rule: some, as the larvÃ¦
of <i>Gnats</i>, becoming pupÃ¦ in two or three weeks; and
others, as those of the <i>EphemerÃ¦</i>, which are thus compensated
for their short life as flies, in as many years<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>.
The cause of all these differences is obviously dependent
on the nature of the food, and the purposes in the economy
of creation to which the larvÃ¦ are destined.</p>


<p>x. The last part of the history of larvÃ¦ relates to their
<i>Preparations for assuming the pupa state</i>. When they
have acquired their full size, after having ceased to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
food, by a copious evacuation they empty the intestinal
canal, even rejecting the membrane that lines it and the
stomach<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>; their colours either change totally, or fade;
and they make themselves ready for entering upon a
new stage of their existence. Some merely rest in a
state of inactivity in the midst of the substances in which
they feed, as if conscious of their inability to select any
safer abode. Of this description are most Coleopterous,
Hymenopterous, and Dipterous larvÃ¦, that feed under
ground, or in the interior of trees, fruits, and seeds.</p>

<p>But a still larger tribe, those which feed on leaves, animals,
&amp;c. act as if more sensible of the insecurity of this
to them important epoch. They are about to exchange
their state of vigour and activity for a long period of deathlike
sleep. The vigilant caution which was wont to guard
them from the attack of their enemies will be henceforward
of no avail. Destitute of all the means of active
defence, their only chance of safety during their often
protracted night of torpor must arise from the privacy of
their place of repose. About this, therefore, they exhibit
the greatest anxiety. Many, after wandering about as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
bewildered, retire to any small hole on the surface of the
earth, covering themselves with dead leaves, moss, or the
like, or to the chinks of trees, or niches in walls and other
buildings, or similar hiding-places. Many penetrate to
the depth of several inches under ground, and there form
an appropriate cavern by pushing away the surrounding
earth; to which they often give consistence by wetting it
with a viscid fluid poured from the mouth. The larvÃ¦
of other insects undertake long and arduous journeys in
search of appropriate places of shelter. Those of flesh-flies,
now satiated with the mass of putridity in which
they have wallowed, leave it, and conceal themselves in
any adjoining heap of dust. The grubs of the gad-fly
(<i>&#338;strus</i>) creep some of them out of the backs of cattle,
in tumours of which they have resided, and suffer themselves
to fall to the earth; while others, which have fed
in the stomach of horses, quit their hold, and by a still
more extraordinary and perilous route are carried through
the intestines the whole length of their numerous circumvolutions,
and are discharged at the anus. And without
enumerating other instances, various aquatic larvÃ¦, as
that of a common fly (<i>Elophilus pendulus</i>), &amp;c. leave the
water, now no longer their proper element, and betake
themselves to the shore, there to undergo their metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Most of these, having reached their selected retreat,
require no other precaution; but another large tribe of
larvÃ¦ have recourse to further man&#339;uvres for their defence
before they assume the pupa. Those of the aphidivorous
flies (<i>Syrphus</i> F. &amp;c.), of the various lady-birds
(<i>Coccinella</i> L.), and tortoise-beetles (<i>Cassida</i> L.), &amp;c. fix
themselves by the anus with a gummy substance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
leaves or twigs under which they propose to conceal themselves
during their existence in that state. Others previously
suspend themselves by a silken thread fixed to the
tail, or passing round the body; by which also, when become
pupÃ¦, they are afterwards pendent in a similar position;
and lastly, a very great number of larvÃ¦ wholly inclose
themselves in cases or cocoons, composed of silk and various
other materials, by which during their state of repose
they are protected both from their enemies and the
action of the atmosphere. As these two last-mentioned
processes are extremely curious and interesting, I shall
not fear tiring you by entering into some further detail
respecting them: explaining <i>first</i> the mode by which larvÃ¦
<i>suspend</i> themselves, both before and after they are
become pupÃ¦, by silken threads; and <i>next</i>, the various
<i>cases</i> or <i>cocoons</i> in which others inclose themselves, and
their manner of operating in the formation of them.</p>


<p>1. The larvÃ¦ which suspend themselves and their pupÃ¦,
with the exception of the tribe of <i>AlucitÃ¦</i>, and some
<i>GeometrÃ¦</i> of the family of <i>G. pendularia</i>, <i>punctaria</i>, &amp;c.
are almost all <i>butterflies</i><a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>. No others follow this mode.
They may be divided into two great classes&mdash;those which
suspend themselves <i>perpendicularly</i> by the <i>tail</i>, and those
which suspend themselves <i>horizontally</i> by means of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
thread girthed round their <i>middle</i>. In both cases it
should be observed, that the suspension of the pupa is
the object in view; but as the process is the work of the
larva, this seems the proper place for explaining it. To
begin with the <i>first</i> case.</p>

<p>You are aware that all <i>lepidopterous</i> larvÃ¦ have the
faculty of spinning silk threads from their mouths, and
it will readily occur to you that it is by means of these
threads that they suspend themselves. But how? How
is a caterpillar to hang itself by the tail to threads spun
from the mouth? Even suppose this difficulty overcome,
others still greater remain. Suppose the caterpillar to
be suspended by its tail,&mdash;this is but a preparatory operation,&mdash;what
is required is, that the pupa shall hang in
the same position: now when you take into consideration
that it is incased <i>within</i> the skin of the larva, and without
feet or other external organs; that it has to extricate itself
from this skin; to hang itself in its place, and to detach
the skin from the threads which hold it&mdash;this will
appear no trifling task. Indeed at first view it seems
impossible. Country-fellows for a prize sometimes amuse
the assembled inhabitants of a village by running races
in sacks: take one of the most active and adroit of these,
bind him hand and foot, suspend him by the bottom of
his sack with his head downwards, to the branch of a
lofty tree; make an opening in one side of the sack, and
set him to extricate himself from it, to detach it from
its hold, and suspend himself by his feet in its place.
Though endowed with the suppleness of an Indian juggler,
and promised his sack full of gold for a reward, you
would set him an absolute impossibility: yet this is what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
our caterpillars, instructed by a beneficent Creator, easily
perform. Their man&#339;uvres I shall now endeavour to
explain.</p>

<p>When the caterpillar has selected the under-side of
the leaf or other object to which it purposes suspending
itself, its first process is to spin upon it a little hillock of
silk consisting of numerous loosely interwoven threads;
it then bends its body so as to insinuate the anal pair of
prolegs amongst these threads, in which, by a slight exertion,
the little crochets which surround them<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> become
so strongly entangled as to support its weight with ease.
It now suffers the anterior part of the body to fall down,
and it hangs perpendicularly from its silken support with
its head downwards. In this position it remains often for
twenty-four hours, at intervals alternately contracting and
dilating itself. At length the skin is seen to split on the
back near the head, and a portion of the pupa appears,
which by repeated swellings acts like a wedge, and rapidly
extends the slit towards the tail. By the continuance
of these alternate contractions and dilatations of the
conical pupa, the skin of the caterpillar is at last collected
in folds near the tail, like a stocking which we roll upon
the ancle before withdrawing it from the foot. But now
comes the important operation. The pupa, being much
shorter than the caterpillar, is as yet at some distance
from the silken hillock on which it is to be fastened; it
is supported merely by the unsplit terminal portion of
the latter's skin. How shall it disengage itself from this
remnant of its case, and be suspended in the air while it
climbs up to take its place? Without arms or legs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
support itself, the anxious spectator expects to see it fall
to the earth. His fears, however, are vain; the supple
segments of the pupa's abdomen serve in the place of
arms. Between two of these, as with a pair of pincers, it
seizes on a portion of the skin; and bending its body once
more, entirely extricates its tail from it. It is now wholly
out of the skin, against one side of which it is supported,
but yet at some distance from the leaf. The next step it
must take is to climb up to the required height. For this
purpose it repeats the same ingenious man&#339;uvre, making
its cast-off skin serve as a sort of ladder, it successively
with different segments seizes a higher and a higher
portion, until in the end it reaches the summit, where
with its tail it feels for the silken threads that are to support
it. But how can the tail be fastened to them? you
ask. This difficulty has been provided against by Creative
Wisdom. The tail of the pupa is furnished with numerous
little hooks pointing in different directions<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>, as
well adapted to the end in view as the crochets of the
larva's prolegs, and some of these hooks are sure to fasten
themselves upon the silk the moment the tail is thrust
amongst it. Our pupa has now nearly completed its labours;
it has withdrawn its tail from the slough, climbed
up it, and suspended itself to the silken hillock&mdash;man&#339;uvres
so delicate and perilous, that we cannot but admire
that an insect which executes them but once in its life,
should execute them so well: nor could it, as Reaumur
has well and piously observed, had it not been instructed
by a <span class="smcap">Great Master</span>. One more exertion remains: it
seems to have as great an antipathy to its cast-off skin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
as one of us should, when newly clothed after a long imprisonment,
to the filthy prison garments we had put off.
It will not suffer this memento of its former state to remain
near it, and is no sooner suspended in security than
it endeavours to make it fall. For this end&mdash;it seizes,
as it were with its tail, the threads to which the skin is
fastened, and then very rapidly whirls itself round, often
not fewer than twenty times. By this man&#339;uvre it generally
succeeds in breaking them, and the skin falls
down. Sometimes, however, the first attempt fails: in
that case, after a moment's rest, it makes a second, twirling
itself in an opposite direction; and this is rarely unsuccessful.
Yet now and then it is forced to repeat its
whirling, not less than four or five times: and Reaumur
has seen instances where the feet of the skin were so firmly
hooked, that after many fruitless efforts the pupa, as if
in despair, gave up the task and suffered it to remain<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>.
After these exertions, it hangs the remainder of its existence
in this state until the butterfly is disclosed.</p>

<p>We are now to consider the <i>second</i> mode of suspension,
in which larvÃ¦ by means of a silken girth round
their middle, fix themselves <i>horizontally</i> under leaves, &amp;c.
These follow the same process with that of those last described,
in spinning a small hillock of silk to which they
fasten their hind legs; and if the operation concerned the
larva state alone, this would be sufficient, as by means of
this support, and of their prolegs, they could easily retain
themselves in a horizontal position. But these larvÃ¦<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
act as if they foresaw the assumption of a state in
which they will be deprived of legs. It is the suspension
of the forthcoming pupa that is the object in view; and
though this can be hung by the tail in the same way with
those of the first class, yet it is plain that it cannot be retained
in a horizontal position, which for some unknown
reason is essential to it, without some support to its anterior
extremity. It is necessary for the larva, therefore,
not only to fix its posterior legs amongst a collection of
silken fibres, but to spin a <i>girth</i> of the same material
round its body. This girth, though apparently of a single
thread, will be found on examination to be composed
of several, often as many as fifty or sixty; and is fastened
on each side of the body of the larva about the middle,
to the surface under which it is placed. Three different
modes of fixing these girths are adopted by the caterpillars
of different butterflies. Some, as those of the common
cabbage-butterfly (<i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>), which have remarkably
pliable bodies, bend them almost double on
one side, then fix the thread and carry it over to the
other in the same position, repeating this operation as
often as is necessary. Others, as that of <i>LycÃ¦na Argus</i>
and many more of the <i>Papiliones Rurales</i> and <i>UrbicolÃ¦</i>
L., which have a short and more rigid body, after
having bent the head on one side so as to fix one end of
the thread, bring themselves into a straight position, and,
by a man&#339;uvre not easily described, contrive to introduce
the head under the thread, which they then bend
themselves to fasten on the other side, pushing it to its
proper situation by the successive tension and contraction
of their segments. But the most curious mode,
though indeed that which seems most natural, is adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
by the caterpillar of the beautiful swallow-tail butterfly
(<i>Papilio Machaon</i>) and others of the same family. This
first forms the loop which is to serve for its girth, and
then creeps under it. But the difficulty it has to surmount
is, to keep itself from being entangled in the fifty or sixty
fine distinct threads of which the girth is composed, and
to preserve them all extended so as to be able to introduce
its body beneath them. For this purpose it makes
use of the two first pair of its fore-legs, employing them
as a woman does her hands in winding a skein of cotton,
to collect and keep all the threads of its card unentangled
and properly stretched; and it is often with great difficulty,
towards the end of the process, that it prevents
them from slipping off. When a sufficient number of
threads is completed, the animal bends its head between
its legs, and insinuates it under the collected loop, which
by its annular contraction it easily pushes to the middle
of the body.</p>

<p>In about thirty hours after the larvÃ¦ which girth themselves
have finished their operations, the skin splits, and
the pupa disengages itself from it by those contractions
and dilatations of its segments which have been before
described, pushing the exuviÃ¦ in folds to the tail, by different
motions of which it generally succeeds in detaching
them. One would have thought there would be considerable
difficulty in slipping the skin past the girth;
but this, according to Reaumur, seems to be easily effected<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>.</p>

<p>If you are desirous of witnessing for yourself the man&#339;uvres
by which these curious modes of suspension are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
effected, you may be readily gratified. It is only necessary
to collect and feed until their metamorphosis the
black spinous caterpillars of the common peacock-butterfly
(<i>Vanessa Io</i>), which in most places may be found
upon nettles, or those of the <i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>, which swarm
in cabbages or brocoli in every garden. The former will
exhibit to you a specimen of <i>vertical</i>, the latter of <i>horizontal</i>
suspension. It should be observed, however, that
to hit the precise moment when these processes are going
on, it is necessary to feed a considerable number of
the larvÃ¦ of each kind; some one of which, if you watch
them narrowly when they have attained their full growth,
you will scarcely fail to surprise in the act.</p>

<p>I must observe here, that although the vertical and
horizontal are the two principal positions in which caterpillars
suspend themselves, yet that others are inclined at
various angles; and some are attached with less art, appearing
only to be fastened by some part of their abdomen
to the body upon which they are fixed<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>.</p>


<p>2. The larvÃ¦ whose procedures I am in the next place
to describe, are those which, previously to assuming the
pupa state, inclose themselves in <i>cases</i> or <i>cocoons</i> of different
materials. For the sake of method, I shall divide
these into two great classes: <i>First</i>, those which form their
cocoons entirely or principally of <i>silk</i>; and <i>secondly</i>,
those which form them chiefly of <i>other substances</i>.</p>

<p>To begin with the <i>first</i>. The larvÃ¦ which inclose
themselves in <i>silken</i> cocoons are chiefly of the Lepidopterous
tribes of <i>BombycidÃ¦</i> and <i>NoctuidÃ¦</i>; but a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
<i>GeometrÃ¦</i> (<i>G. papilioniaria</i>, <i>lactearia</i>, &amp;c.); most of the
<i>Hymenoptera</i>; some <i>Coleoptera</i>, as certain of the weevil
tribe (<i>Hypera Arator</i>, <i>Rumicis</i> Germ.), and those brilliant
beetles frequenting aquatic plants constituting the
genus <i>Donacia</i> F.; the Neuropterous genera <i>Hemerobius</i>
and <i>Myrmeleon</i>; <i>Mycetophila</i> and a few others in the
<i>Diptera</i>; and <i>Pulex</i> in the <i>Aphaniptera</i> fabricate coverings
of the same material. In all, with the exception of
<i>Myrmeleon</i> and <i>Hemerobius</i> (and perhaps <i>Hypera Rumicis</i>,
&amp;c.?) which have their spinning apparatus at the
extremity of the abdomen, the silken thread employed in
forming these coverings proceeds from the middle part of
the under-lip, as before explained; and is in fact composed
of two threads gummed together as they issue from
the two adjoining orifices of the spinner.</p>

<p>Of the larvÃ¦ which inclose themselves in <i>silk</i>, the most
familiarly known is the silk-worm: the cocoon of this
consists exteriorly of a thin, transparent, gauze-like coating,
through the interstices of which can be seen an inner,
smaller, oval ball of a more close and compact texture.
The whole is in fact composed of one single
thread, but arranged in two distinct modes. To form
the <i>exterior</i> envelope, which is merely the scaffolding by
means of which the inner and more solid covering is constructed,
the caterpillar, after fixing upon a space between
two leaves or twigs or angles suitable for its purpose,
begins by glueing one end of its thread to one of the adjoining
surfaces. This thread it next conducts to another
part and then fastens, repeating this process and interlacing
it in various directions, until it has surrounded itself
with a slight and loosely spun netting. In the centre
of this, when contracted into a space sufficiently small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
it lays the foundation of the <i>interior</i> cocoon. Fixing itself
by its prolegs to some of the surrounding threads,
it bends its body, and by successive motions of its head
from side to side spins a layer of silk on the side opposite
to it: when this is of the requisite thickness, the larva
shifts its position, and repeats the same process in another
quarter, covering each layer in turn with a new one
until the interior cavity is reduced to the size desired.
Thus, the silken thread which forms this new cocoon is
not, as might have been supposed, wound circularly as
we wind the thread of a ball of cotton; but backwards and
forwards in a series of zigzags, so as to compose a number
of distinct layers. Malpighi could distinguish six of
these layers<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>, and Reaumur suspects there is often a
greater number<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>. The former found the length of the
thread of silk composing them when wound off, without
including the exterior case, to be not less than 930 feet<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>;
but others have computed it at more than a thousand<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>:
consequently the threads of five cocoons united would be
a mile in length. Estimating by the weight,&mdash;the thread
of a pound of cocoons, each of which weighs about two
grains and a half, would extend more than 600 miles<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>,
and such is its tenuity, that the threads of five or six cocoons
require to be joined to form one of the thickness
requisite in the silk manufacture. It is the continuous
thread of the inner cocoon which is most valuable; the
outer loose coating from its irregularity cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
wound off, and is known in commerce by the name of <i>floss
silk</i>.</p>

<p>Man&#339;uvres in their general principle similar to those
of the silk-worm are followed by most of those larvÃ¦
which inclose themselves in silken cocoons. Many species,
however, adopt variations in the mode of procedure
all of which it would be tedious to particularize, but some
of them are worth mentioning. The larvÃ¦ of <i>Tortrix
prasinana</i>, and other species of moths which form cocoons
resembling a reversed boat, arrange their threads
in layers, so as to construct two parallel walls gradually
inclining towards the top and ends, where they finally
force them to approach each other by means of an apparatus
of silken cables<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>. And the larva of <i>Saturnia Pavonia</i>,
though it forms the base of its flask-shaped cocoon by
spinning like the silk-worm a number of interwoven zigzags,
places the threads which compose the interior funnel-like
opening of the apex nearly straight, parallel to
each other, and converging towards the same point in
the centre<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>.</p>

<p>These last, as well as almost all larvÃ¦, constantly remain
in the <i>inside</i> of the cocoon during its construction.
But De Geer has given us the history of a minute caterpillar
of a species of moth (<i>Tinea</i> L.) which feeds on the
under side of the leaves of the <i>Rhamnus Frangula</i>, or
Black Alder, that actually weaves half of its cocoon on the
<i>outside</i>. This cocoon, which is very small, is beautifully
fluted, consisting of several longitudinal cords, with the
intervals filled by fine net-work, and shaped like a reversed
boat<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>. The animal begins by laying the foundations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of one of the ends of her cocoon, she adds new
threads to this small beginning, and so proceeds. As
the work advances she retreats backwards, and her body
is situated nearly in the same line with the cocoon she
has begun, and quite <i>out</i> of it; she only touches with her
head and legs its anterior margin. When half the cocoon,
or rather of its exterior layer, is finished, she suspends
her operations for some moments. She then for
the first time introduces her head <i>into</i> this demi-cocoon,
and turns herself in it by doubling her supple body, and
passing one part over the other, so that at last she manages
to bring her tail into the pointed end of the cocoon,
the head and the anterior half of her body remaining
without. Thus situated, she commences her operations
afresh. At a distance from the margin of the demi-cocoon,
equal to its length, she begins to spin the pointed
end of the other moiety, the length of her body serving
her as a measure that enables her to begin at the proper
distance from it. This new portion she spins in the same
manner as the other; but as she is prevented by the demi-cocoon
in which the posterior part of her body is lodged
from retreating backwards, she contracts her body more,
which answers the same purpose. When the new work
is so advanced that she can no longer contract her body,
she bends the anterior part of it considerably, and reverses
her head. When the distance between the margin
of the two halves of the cocoon is very small, so as no
longer to admit the head between them, in order to unite
them she is obliged to have recourse to another man&#339;uvre.
Withdrawing her head, she extends silken longitudinal
threads between the two margins, and thus unites
them. This part is more clumsy, and not so regular as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the rest of the cocoon, so that the point of union is always
discoverable. These caterpillars do not always divide
the cocoon into two <i>equal</i> portions, for often they will
finish three quarters of the cocoon before they enter it,
and begin at the other end<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>.</p>

<p>The general rule is,&mdash;that each larva spins for itself a
separate cocoon; but amongst those of <i>Arctia chrysorhea</i>
and others which live in society, two or three sometimes
begin their operations so close together that they are
under the necessity of forming one common cocoon, which
serves for a covering to the whole number. The same
thing happens to silk-worms, the double or treble cocoons
of which are called <i>Dupions</i> by the breeders. The larvÃ¦
of some Ichneumons, besides forming each its separate
cocoon, spin a joint cottony covering for the whole<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>,
which is effected thus:&mdash;After they leave the caterpillar
they have devoured, they fix themselves side by side at a
little distance from it, and begin to spin each a cocoon;
and in order to defend its end and side that is not covered
by others, they spin further an envelope of loose silk,
and thus this exterior covering is formed.</p>

<p>The size, figure, colour, substance, and texture of
silken cocoons are extremely various. Their <i>size</i> indeed
is usually proportioned to that of the included larva or
pupa; yet it is by no means always so. Some large caterpillars
spin cocoons so small, that the observer can
hardly conceive how they can be contained in so narrow
a compass: <i>Eriogaster Catax</i> is a moth of this description<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>.
And others smaller in size lodge themselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
apartments apparently much more spacious than necessary.
The transparent hammock-like cocoons of <i>Hepialus
Humuli</i> and <i>Arctia villica</i>, two other moths, would
contain several of their pupÃ¦. I possess one in which
the pupa is suspended in the centre, that is ten times its
size, and not very short in dimensions of that of <i>Attacus
Paphia</i>, a giant silk-moth. The largest cocoon I ever
read or heard of, is that thus described by Mr. Hobhouse
in his <i>Travels</i>: "Depending," says he, "from the boughs
of the pines, near the Attic mountain Parnes, and stretching
across from tree to tree so as to obstruct our passage,
were the pods, <i>thrice as big as a turkey's egg!</i> and the
thick webs of a chrysalis, whose moth must be far larger
than any of those in our country."<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> If this statement
is correct, and I am not aware that there is any reason
for doubting it, the cocoon must be vastly larger than the
pupa, or the moth it produced would far exceed in size
any yet known. Perhaps, however, as this gentleman is
probably no entomologist, what he took for a cocoon
might be a nidus, in which many larvÃ¦ were associated,
of the nature of those formerly described<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>figure</i>, the majority are like those of
the silk-worm, of a shape more or less oval or elliptic:
some, however, vary from this. That of <i>Lasiocampa
Rubi</i> is oblong. I have one from New Holland somewhat
resembling an acorn, fixed to the twigs of some tree
or shrub, of a very close silk, and covered by a circular
operculum, which the animal pushes off when it assumes
the imago; this is ovate or conico-ovate; others again are
globose<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>; others are conical<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>, as that of <i>Gastropacha</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
<i>quercifolia</i>; others almost fusiform<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> (<i>Odenesis potatoria</i>).
Reaumur received one from Arabia which was nearly
cylindrical<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>. Those of <i>T. prasinana</i> before noticed, and
many other <i>Tortrices</i>, are shaped like a reversed boat<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>;
that of <i>Saturnia Pavonia</i> and others of the same tribe,
like a Florence flask with a wide and short neck. The
cocoon of <i>LygÃ¦na FilipendulÃ¦</i> resembles a grain of barley.
Another cocoon in my cabinet, of very slight network,
is shaped something like an air-balloon. But the
most remarkable one for its form and characters, is one
that I received from the rich cabinet above quoted. This,
which is of an unusually close texture, is suspended by
a thread more than two inches long from the point of a
leaf; it then swells into a perfect cone, at the base about
four-fifths of an inch in diameter and half an inch in
length, and covered with scattered setiform appendages:
from the centre of the base projects a large hemispherical
protuberance, which terminates in a long stalk, much
thicker than the thread that suspends the cocoon. There
is commonly no difference between the shape of cocoons
spun by larvÃ¦ which are to give birth to different sexes of
the same species. The silk-worm cocoons, however,
which will produce <i>male</i> moths, have more silk at the
ends, and consequently are more round than those which
are to produce <i>females</i>: but the difference is not striking.</p>

<p>The most usual <i>colour</i> of silken cocoons is white, yellow,
or brown, or the intermediate shades. The whites
are very pure in the general envelope of some species
of <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i>, and yellows often very brilliant. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
besides these more general colours, some cocoons are
black<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>, some few blue or green, and others red<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>. Sometimes
the same cocoon is of two different colours. Those
of certain parasites of the tribe of <i>Ichneumones minuti</i> L.
the motions of one of which I noticed on a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>,
are alternately banded with black or brown and
white, or have only a pale or white belt in the middle,
which gives them a singular appearance. In both cases
the difference in colour depends upon the different tints
with which the silky gum is imbued in the reservoirs:
the first portion of it is white, and with this the larva
first sketches the outline of its cocoon, and then thickens
the layers of silk considerably in those parts where the
white bands appear: when these are finished, its stock
of white silk is exhausted, and the remainder of the interior
of the cocoon is composed of brown silk<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>. The circular
operculum above mentioned as covering an acorn-shaped
cocoon, is paler than the latter, and also ornamented
by a zone within the margin of deep brown.
The pale cocoon also of <i>Attacus Paphia</i> is veined with
silk of a deep red.</p>

<p>I have very little to say on the <i>substance</i> of the silk of
cocoons. Though that of the silk-worm is composed of
such a slender thread, that of many others is still finer,
scarcely yielding in tenuity to the spider's web. On the
other hand, the silk of the cocoons of <i>Saturnia Pavonia</i>
and of several foreign species is as thick as a hair.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>texture</i> of their cocoons&mdash;in some,
as in that of the silk-worm, the threads are so slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
glued to each other, as to separate with facility; but in
that of the emperor-moth just mentioned they are intimately
connected by a gummy matter, furnished, as
Reaumur conjectures, from the anus<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>, with which the
whole interior of the cocoon is often plastered. Some,
as that of the silk-worm, are composed of an exterior
loose envelope, and an inner compact ball; others have
no exterior covering, the whole cocoon being of an uniform
and thick texture. The larva of <i>Cossus RobiniÃ¦</i>
Peck, in spinning its cocoon, makes the end next the
opening to the air, by which the imago is to emerge, of a
slighter texture than the rest of it<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>. The exterior case
is sometimes, as in <i>Laria pudibunda</i>, very closely woven,
so as to resemble a real cocoon<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>: its form is usually
adapted to that of the inner one; but in some which fix
them under flat surfaces (<i>Laria fascelina</i>, <i>Callimorpha
Caja</i>,) it resembles a hammock<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>. Cocoons of a close
texture have generally no orifice in any part; but that of
<i>Eriogaster lanestris</i> is spun with openings, as if bored
from without, the use of which, however, does not seem
to have been ascertained<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.</p>

<p>Many silken cocoons are of so close a fabric, as, when
finished, entirely to conceal the included insect; but a
very considerable number are of a more open texture,
composed of a much smaller quantity of silk, and that
woven so loosely, that the larva or pupa may always be
discovered through it. Of this description are the cocoons
of <i>Hypogymna dispar</i>, <i>Arctia Salicis</i>, &amp;c., which
consist only of a few slight meshes. Those of some others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
resemble gauze or lace<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>. Of the first description is one
in my cabinet before alluded to, shaped somewhat like
an air-balloon; the meshes are large and perfectly square.
The pupa hangs in the centre, fixed by some few slight
threads which diverge from it to all parts of the cocoon&mdash;so
that it looks as if it was suspended in the air, like
Mahomet's coffin, without support. Of the second description
is a black one with very fine and nearly circular
meshes: the threads that form these are thick, and seem
to be agglutinated. In our own country, the cocoons of
some beetles, as of <i>Hypera Arator</i>, <i>Galeruca Tanaceti</i>, and
of some little <i>TineÃ¦</i>, also resemble gauze. Many of the
larvÃ¦, however, which spin these cocoons, whose thinness
is probably attributable to the smallness of their
stock of silk, seem anxious for a more complete concealment;
and therefore commonly either hide them between
leaves tied together, in some with a certain regularity,
in others without art<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>; or thicken their texture, and
render it opaque, by the addition of grains of earth<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>,
or of other materials with which their bodies supply
them. These are principally of two kinds. The
larvÃ¦ of <i>Lasiocampa Neustria</i>, <i>Arctia Salicis</i>, &amp;c. after
spinning their cocoons, cast from their anus three or four
masses of a soft and paste-like matter, which they apply
with their head all round the inside of the cavity; and
which, drying in a short time, becomes a powder that
effectually renders it opake. This is not, as might be
conjectured, an excrement, but a true secretion, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
intended for this very purpose: and, according to Reaumur,
a similar powder, but white, derived from the varicose
intestines, is used by the caterpillars of <i>Gastropacha
quercifolia</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> The other material, which is still more
frequently employed, and which is occasionally mixed
with the former, is the <i>hair</i> which everyone has observed
to cover so thickly the bodies of some caterpillars. This,
after spinning a sufficient envelope, they tear, or in some
instances cut off with their mandibles, and distribute all
round them, pushing it with their head amongst the interstices
of the silk, so as to make the whole of a regular
thick texture. After this process, which leaves the body
completely denuded, and often seems to give them great
pain, they conclude by spinning another tissue of slight
silk, in order to protect the forthcoming pupa from the
surrounding prickly points. It should be observed, however,
that though many hairy larvÃ¦, as those of <i>Noctua
Aceris</i>, <i>Arctia Caja</i>, and others, employ their hairs in the
composition of their cocoons, the rule is not general,
several never making any such use of them. Nor do all
that do so employ them distribute them in the same manner
as those above described, which rarely attempt to
arrange them in any regular position. Reaumur has noticed
a small hairy caterpillar that feeds on lichens, which
is more methodical: this actually places its hairs upright,
side by side, as regularly as the pales in a palisade, in
an oval ring around its body, connecting them by a slight
tissue of silk, which forces them to bend into a sort of
roof at the top; and under this curiously-formed cocoon
assumes its state of pupa<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>. Some larvÃ¦ make so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
hair and so little silk enter into the composition of their
cocoons, that on the first inspection they would be pronounced
wholly composed of it<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>; others, thickening the
interior of their cocoon with hair, line the whole with a
viscid matter like varnish<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>.</p>

<p>The larvÃ¦ of some saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.) are remarkable
for inclosing themselves in a double cocoon, in
which the inner is not, as in the silk-worm &amp;c., connected
with the outer, but perfectly distinct from it. Some species,
as <i>T. RosÃ¦</i> (<i>Cryptus</i> Jur.), which have but a small
stock of silk, compose the outer cocoon of thick silken
cords crossing at right angles, and forming an oval net;
which at the same time that it protects them effectually
from the ants, which are always ready to attack them, demands
much less silk than a covering of a closer texture.
But the tender nymph itself requires to be inclosed in a
case of a softer and more delicate substance; and accordingly
the inner cocoon is composed of fine silk, woven
so closely that the threads are scarcely perceptible under
a microscope<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>. Reaumur mentions a hymenopterous
larva belonging to Latreille's <i>Fossores</i> (<i>Sphex</i> L.) which
thickened its cocoon with the legs, wings, and other relics
of the flies which it had devoured<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>: trophies&mdash;like the
drinking-cups of some savages, made of the skulls of their
enemies, or the skull pyramid near Ispahan&mdash;of its
powers of devastation.</p>

<p>It is a general rule, that those larvÃ¦ which spin cocoons,
never in ordinary circumstances become pupÃ¦
without having thus inclosed themselves. An exception,
however, is met with in the larva of a species of ant noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
by De Geer (<i>Formica fusca</i> L.), some of the individuals
of which inclose themselves in cocoons; while
others neglect this precaution, and undergo their metamorphosis
uncovered<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>. RÃ¶sel also made nearly the
same observation on the larva of the flea<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>.</p>

<p>I must say something with regard to the <i>situation</i>,
often very remote from their place of feeding, in which
larvÃ¦ fabricate their cocoons. A very considerable number,
probably the majority, form them either partially
(<i>Arctia lubricipeda</i>) or wholly under ground; others
beneath dead leaves, moss, or in the chinks of the trees;
others within the wood in substances on which they
have fed; the larva of <i>Cossus</i> leaves in these a communication
with the open air by which the imago emerges;
and a large number attach them to the leaves and
branches of trees and plants; the cocoon of <i>Donacia fasciata</i>(?)
is fastened by one side to the roots or surculi of
<i>Typha latifolia</i>. There is usually nothing very remarkable
in the mode of fixing them, the exterior threads
being merely gummed irregularly to different portions of
the objects which support them. But some effect this with
greater art. I have one from New Holland, very long,
which is suspended from a twig by a long riband, as it
were, which entirely girths the twig. The larva of the
magnificent silk-moth, <i>Attacus Paphia</i>, actually forms a
solid silken stalk to its cocoon, an inch and half in length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and a line in diameter, fastened by the other extremity
to a twig, which it closely surrounds as if with a ring,
at first sight resembling a fruit of a very singular appearance<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>.
I have specimens of this cocoon with both
stalk and ring. A bell-shaped cocoon fastened by a foot-stalk,
but of softer consistence, to a blade of grass, found
by Mr. Sheppard, I can also show you; and my friend
Mr. Wilkin had a similar one out of the late Mr. Hudson's
collection. Most larvÃ¦ spin their cocoons in solitude:
some of those, however, which live in society do it
close together under their common tent.</p>

<p>There are other cocoons that should be noticed here,
such as those formed by the larva of <i>ZygÃ¦na FilipendulÃ¦</i>,
and some <i>Bombyces</i>, saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.), and beetles
(<i>Curculio</i>, <i>Donacia</i> F.), &amp;c. These are formed of
a substance which seems more analogous to gum than
silk, yet furnished from the silk reservoirs, and usually
present the appearance externally of parchment or membrane.
That of the insect first mentioned is coated,
however, with a slight interior silken lining; as indeed
are almost all cocoons, of whatever substance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>second</i> class, into which I have divided larvÃ¦ that
inclose themselves in cocoons, includes those which form
their coverings not solely or principally of silk, but in
which other materials are mixed more or less. The cocoons
of some of these larvÃ¦ are merely composed of a
few leaves slightly tied together, either irregularly, or arranged,
particularly when they are of a linear figure, with
considerable symmetry. The grubs of many beetles, as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the rose-beetle, <i>Cetonia aurata</i>, &amp;c., prepare themselves a
cocoon, composed of earth, pieces of rotten wood, and any
substances within their reach: which they fasten together
with a glutinous secretion. The same material is employed
by others in forming a cocoon wholly of earth; which
is sometimes, as that of the stag-beetle, <i>Lucanus Cervus</i>,
exceedingly hard; at others, as that of some moths,
<i>Noctua ambigua</i>, &amp;c., so slight as to fall to pieces as soon
as touched<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>. Other cocoons are formed of grains of
earth. Reaumur has given a very interesting account of
the procedures of a larva in repairing one of these cocoons,
from which he had broken off the top when just
completed. Without quitting the interior of the walls
that remained, it put out its head from the breach, and
for more than an hour employed itself in selecting one
by one grains of earth, which it conveyed with its mandibles
and deposited within its case: it next spun all round
the opening threads of silk, to which it attached grains
of earth taken from the previously-stored heap, uniting
them compactly by means of other silken threads. After
employing three hours in this laborious process, the industrious
little mason had reduced the diameter of the
breach to a few lines. Reaumur was very curious to
know how it would fill up this orifice, which would no
longer admit the protrusion of its head outside the walls,
as in its previous operations. He concluded, that while
the rest of the cocoon was exteriorly formed of earth,
this opening would be merely closed with silk. He was
mistaken, however: the artist knew how to vary its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
man&#339;uvres, and make its vault of one uniform texture.
It spun across the opening a little net of silk, between the
meshes of which it thrust grains of earth so dexterously
that they projected as far as the outer surface, retained
there probably by silken lines previously attached and
fastened within. It then finished its habitation by fortifying
the inside of the orifice with another layer of earth<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>.
The ant-lion (<i>Myrmeleon</i>) spins a globular cocoon with
its anus, which it covers with grains of sand<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>. One that I
took in the forest of Fontainebleau, in the quarry that produces
the crystallized sandstone called the <i>Fontainebleau
fossil</i>, was covered with large and shining grains. Instead
of the grains of earth or sand employed by these larvÃ¦,
those of another tribe substitute grains of stone detached
from the softer walls, upon whose lichens they previously
feed, which they unite into solid oval cocoons<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>. Those
of a fourth form their cocoons of patches of short moss
arranged with the roots downwards, and forming a vault,
as it were, of verdant turf, admirably adapted for concealment<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>.
The larvÃ¦ of some moths form their cocoons
of irregular pieces of bark tied together with silk, and
resembling when completed a knotty protuberance of the
twig on which they are fixed. That of <i>Pyralis tuberculana</i>
constructs a pannier-shaped one of the parenchyma
of the leaves of plants<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>.</p>

<p>All these cocoons, however, must yield in point of
singularity of construction, materials, and ingenuity, to
one formed by a small caterpillar, described by the illustrious
naturalist lately quoted, which feeds upon the oak.
This cocoon is wholly composed of small rectangular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
strap-shaped pieces of the fine upper skin, or epidermis
of the twig upon which it rests, regularly fastened to each
other in a longitudinal direction with very slender silken
cords. But the mode of its construction is even more
remarkable than the substance of which it is fabricated.
The caterpillar's first process is to form its slips of bark
into two flat triangular wing-like pieces, projecting opposite
to each other from each side of the twig, somewhat
like the feathers of an arrow. It does not, perhaps, require
any great degree of intelligence in a larva to give
its cocoon the usual oval form, when it begins to arrange
its materials in that shape from the very first, and round
so good a mould as its own bent body; but we surely must
admit that it is a task to which no stupid artist would be
competent, to form first a multitude of strap-shaped laminÃ¦
into two triangular plates, and then to bend these
plates into a case resembling the longitudinal section of a
cone, with an elliptical and protuberant base,&mdash;the figure
which the cocoon of this insect assumes. All the minutiÃ¦
of the man&#339;uvres which it employs in this nice operation
could not be comprehended without a more diffuse
explanation than I have here room to give: suffice it to
say, that the caterpillar fastens silken lines to each exterior
opposite and longer side of the laminÃ¦, and by applying
all the weight of its body forces them to bend and approach
each other, in which position it secures them by
other shorter lines. It next repeats the same process
with the upper and shorter sides of the plates; which
when joined form the base of the cocoon. Both these
tasks are accomplished in less than an hour, and the seams
are so nicely joined as to be imperceptible. A fine inner
tapestry of silk, covering all the asperities of the exterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
walls, concludes its labours<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>. It is to be lamented that
Reaumur was unacquainted with the moth that proceeds
from the pupÃ¦ inclosed in these ingenious cocoons;
which being small, and precisely of the same colour as
the bark of the twig that supports them, are not to be
discovered but by a very narrow inspection. It would
seem, however, to be <i>Noctua Strigula</i> of Berkhausen,
<i>Pyralis strigulalis</i> of Hubner<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>. The larva, he informs
us, is found in May: its body is flatter than common, of
a yellowish flesh-colour, clothed with tufts of red hair on
each segment, and furnished with fourteen feet. Should
this description enable you to detect it upon your oaks,
a view of its ingenious procedures would amply repay
you for the trouble of seeking for it. The larvÃ¦ of <i>Cerura
vinula</i>, <i>Stauropus Fagi</i>, and several other moths,
form their cocoons of grains of wood gnawed from the
trees on which they feed. These grains they masticate,
mixed with a glutinous fluid secreted from the mouth,
into a paste, which forms a covering of an uniform smooth
texture, and so hard as not readily to yield to a knife.
Of a substance apparently nearly similar is composed
the cocoon of a weevil related to <i>Liparus Pini</i>; which
with its inhabitant was given me by the ingenious Mr.
Bullock. A little moth, whose ravages have been before
noticed<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>, lines the interior of the grain of barley, of
which it has devoured the contents, with silk; divides it
into two apartments, into one of which it pushes the excrement
it had voided, and in the other assumes the pupa<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>.</p>

<p>These, and the other larvÃ¦ mentioned above, commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
form their cocoons of the substances I have indicated;
but when by any cause they are prevented from
access to them, they often substitute such other materials
as are at hand. Reaumur fed a larva that formed its
cocoon of minute fragments of paper, which with its
mandibles it had cut from the piece that covered the glass
vessel that contained it<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>: and the same circumstance
happened to Bonnet.</p>

<p>Upon a former occasion I described to you the cases
of various kinds formed and inhabited by the insects of
the <i>Trichoptera</i> Order (<i>Phryganea</i> L.) commonly called
case-worms<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>. As these serve for the pupa as well as
the larva, they may be regarded as a kind of cocoon. I
shall not repeat here what I then said; but having purchased
from the collection of the late Mr. Francillon
some that seem to belong to this or some cognate tribe,
that are of a curious construction, I shall give you some
account of two or three of them in this place. The first
is not quite three inches long, of a sublanceolate shape,
but rather widest towards one end. It consists of an internal
tough and thick bag or cocoon, of a silk resembling
fine wool of a dirty white colour, which is closely
covered transversely by pieces of the stalk of a plant,
about three-fourths of an inch in length, and crossing
each other at an obtuse angle. The next is thicker and
shorter: the internal bag is just covered with small fragments
of wood like sawdust; over these are fastened irregularly,
short stout pieces of a pithy stick or stalk, and
the whole is clothed with a very close-woven ash-coloured
web. It seems difficult to conceive how the inclosed
animal could contrive to cover her habitation with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
this web without going wholly out of it. The third is
the most curious and remarkable of all. It is nearly six
inches long, and about four-fifths of an inch in diameter.
It consists of a bag of thick cinereous silk web, to which
are fastened, in a sextuple series, pieces of stick about an
inch long, the end of one mostly resting upon the base of
another: between each series a space of about three-tenths
of an inch intervenes, but at the apex they all converge.
This probably imitates the branch or stem of some tree
or plant, in which the leaves are linear, and diverge but
little from the stem. A label upon it states its country to
be New Holland. I suspect the inhabitants of the two
last cocoons to be terrestrial animals: the first is probably
a true aquatic case-worm.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same purpose for which the cocoons above described
serve, is answered in the case of numerous <i>Dipterous</i>
insects, by a humble and less artificial contrivance&mdash;the
skin, namely, of the larva; which, as was before
observed<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>, is never cast, but, when the insect is about
to enter into the pupa state, assumes a different form and
colour; becomes of a thicker and more rigid texture;
and defends the included pupa, which is separate from it,
till its exclusion. In this case the mouth of the larva is
constantly different from that of the perfect insect, or at
least has not with it those relations as to number and
kind of organs, which have been observed in the mouth
of other larvÃ¦ compared with the insects that they produce.
The animal, immediately after it is clothed with
this skin, if it is opened, exhibits only a soft gelatinous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
pulp, in the surface of which the exterior organs of the
adult insect cannot yet be detected. Nature requires
more time for their elaboration, or at least for the appearance
of their outline, and to consolidate them. This
pulp first takes an oblong form (<i>Boule allongÃ©e</i> Reaum.),
and afterwards that of the insect it is destined to give
birth to<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>. The skin of the larva also serves for a cocoon
to the pupÃ¦ of male <i>Cocci</i><a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>. The grub of the genus <i>Anthrenus</i>,
so destructive to our cabinets of natural objects<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>,
when it assumes the pupa does not quit its skin, but only
splits it open longitudinally on the back, and when it
becomes an imago makes its exit through the orifice<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>.
Some Lepidopterous larvÃ¦ even (<i>Alucita pentadactyla</i>,
<i>Callimorpha rosea</i>, &amp;c.) assume the pupa state within
their last skin<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When a larva has finished its cocoon,&mdash;which with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
some species, that proceed so earnestly as though they
had not a moment to lose, is the work of a few hours, of
others about two or three days,&mdash;after a certain interval
it casts its last skin, which is usually suffered to remain
in the cocoon (but which one moth, <i>Geometra lacertinaria</i>,
ejects through an opening purposely left in its bottom),
and the pupa makes its appearance<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>. This interval is
exceedingly various. Most larvÃ¦ assume the pupa state
within a few days after they have formed their cocoons;
but some not for several weeks, or even months. The
caterpillar of <i>Bombyx cÃ¦ruleocephala</i>, according to RÃ¶sel,
lies three weeks in the cocoon before this change is effected;
those of many <i>Pupivora</i> and <i>DiplolepariÃ¦</i> Latr.,
according to Reaumur, six months<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>; that of <i>PhalÃ¦na
urticata</i> nine months<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>; and that of <i>Cimbex lutea</i>, according
to De Geer, sometimes eighteen months<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>. Brahm
observes, that such larvÃ¦ of the double-brooded moth,
<i>Hepialus Testudo</i>, as form their cocoons in autumn, do
not become pupÃ¦ until the following spring; while those
which form them in summer undergo this change in a
few days<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>. From this fact it might be conjectured, that
the degree of heat prevailing at the time the insect incloses
itself determines the period of the pupa's appearance;
but this supposition seems contradicted by what
Reaumur observed of a brood of the larvÃ¦ of <i>PhalÃ¦na
urticata</i>, just mentioned, which, though they formed
themselves cocoons in September, did not become pupÃ¦
till the June following<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>. I am unable, therefore, to assign
any plausible cause for these extraordinary variations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
The difficulty of comprehending how animals before
so voracious can live so long without food may be
partly surmounted, by adverting to the circumstance of
its having attained its full growth, and laid up a store of
nutriment for the development of the perfect insect. It
is consequently no more wonderful that it should not
have need of any further supply without casting off its
upper integument, than that it should not eat after having
done so and become a pupa.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XXXI" id="LETTER_XXXI">LETTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<h3><i>STATES OF INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>PUPA STATE.</h5>


<p>We have now traced our little animals through their
egg and larva states, and have arrived at the third stage
of their existence, <i>the Pupa State</i>. This, to include all,
can only be defined,&mdash;that state intervening between the
larva and imago, in which the parts and organs of the
perfect insect, particularly those of sex, though in few
cases fully developed, are prepared and fitted for their
final and complete development in the last-mentioned
state; and in which the majority of these animals are
incapable of locomotion, or of taking food.</p>

<p>PupÃ¦, like larvÃ¦, may be separated into two great divisions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-1em">

<p>I. Those which, in general form, more or less resemble
the larvÃ¦ from which they have proceeded.</p>

<p>II. Those which are wholly unlike the larvÃ¦ from
which they have proceeded.</p></blockquote>

<p>I. To the first division belong, with some exceptions<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the <i>Dermaptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Hemiptera</i>, and most <i>Aptera</i>,
with the neuropterous tribes of <i>Libellulina</i>, <i>Ephemerina</i>,
and the genus <i>Termes</i>, in the class <i>Insecta</i>; and the majority
of the <i>Arachnida</i>. This, like the first division of
larvÃ¦, may be subdivided into two corresponding smaller
sections; the first including those pupÃ¦ which resemble
the larvÃ¦, except in the relative proportion and number
of some of their parts; and the second those that resemble
them, except in having the rudiments of wings, or of
wings and elytra.</p>

<p>i. The first subdivision will include the pupÃ¦, if they
may be so called<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>, of insects of the <i>Aptera</i> order, and of
the class <i>Arachnida</i>: as, lice, <i>PodurÃ¦</i>, <i>LepismidÃ¦</i>, centipedes,
millipedes, mites, harvest-men, spiders, scorpions,
&amp;c. These mostly differ from their larvÃ¦ only in that
the relative length or number of their legs, the number of
the segments of the body in some, or the development of
their palpi, more nearly approach the characters of the
perfect insect; and in that while in their larva state they
have two or more skins to cast, previously to their assumption
of the imago, in their pupa state they have but one.
In fact, this last circumstance is the only one which,
strictly speaking, characterizes the pupÃ¦ of this subdivision;
as the changes which take place in the number and
proportion of the organs are partly produced with each
change of the larva's skin. And hence, as it is not easy
to ascertain what number of skins a spider, for example,
has yet to cast, and as both the larva and pupa differ so
little from the perfect insect, it is very difficult to determine
in what state insects of this division are. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
this difficulty has probably arisen the too great multiplication
of species in some of these tribes, particularly the
<i>Arachnida</i>, the larva and pupa having been mistaken for
perfect insects. The pupÃ¦ of this subdivision were
named by LinnÃ© <i>complete</i>, from the near resemblance
which they bear to the imago.</p>

<p>ii. The second subdivision will include the pupÃ¦ of
the <i>Dermaptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Hemiptera</i> orders, with
few exceptions; as likewise the <i>Libellulina</i>, <i>Ephemerina</i>,
and <i>Termitina</i>? amongst the <i>Neuroptera</i>: including the
well-known tribes of earwigs, cockroaches, crickets,
grasshoppers, locusts, lanthorn-flies, froghoppers (<i>Cicada</i>
L.), bugs, plant-lice, dragon-flies, day-flies, white
ants, &amp;c. Of these, as in the former subdivision, the
pupÃ¦ are equally capable of eating and moving with the
larvÃ¦, which they resemble, except in having the rudiments
of wings, or of wings and elytra. The pupÃ¦ of
the three orders first enumerated differ from those of the
<i>Neuroptera</i> in resembling the perfect insect in most instances,
both as to shape and the organs for taking their
food; and in all other respects, except in not having their
wings and elytra fully developed<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>. The resemblance of
the pupÃ¦ of the <i>Libellulina</i> and <i>Ephemerina</i> to the perfect
insects is more distant, and the above organs in the
two states are very dissimilar; for the pupÃ¦ of the former
are furnished with a prehensory mask similar to that of
the larvÃ¦ before described<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>, which the perfect insect has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
not; and those of the latter with the usual oral organs of
masticating insects, of which the imago has scarcely the
rudiments.</p>

<p>I have applied the term <i>rudiments</i> to the wings and
elytra in this state, not in a strict sense, but merely to
denote their appearance; for in fact the wings, &amp;c. are
complete, but only folded up longitudinally and transversely,
and inclosed in membranous cases, which when
the last change takes place remain attached to the puparium
or pupa-case. The tegmina or hemelytra in this
state usually cover the wings, and the upper wings the
under; but in the <i>Libellulina</i> both are usually visible.
Though commonly very small compared with the instruments
of flight in the perfect insect, some of these rudiments,
contrasted with the majority, are of considerable
magnitude. This is the case with those of some species
of <i>Chermes</i>, as we learn from De Geer<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>.</p>


<p>II. The second grand division comprises by far the
largest number of pupÃ¦: those of all <i>coleopterous</i>, <i>strepsipterous</i>,
<i>lepidopterous</i>, <i>hymenopterous</i>, <i>dipterous</i>, and
<i>aphanipterous</i>, and by far the majority of <i>neuropterous</i> insects,
as well as the <i>hemipterous</i> genus <i>Aleyrodes</i>, and one
sex of <i>Coccus</i> of the same order. These pupÃ¦, however,
though agreeing in the circumstance of being unlike the
larvÃ¦ from which they proceed, differ from each other in
several respects, and require to be divided into three
great sections, as under:&mdash;</p>

<p>i. Those pupÃ¦ in which the <i>parts</i> of the future insect,
being folded up under a membranous skin closely applying
to each, are distinctly <i>visible</i>. To this head belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
generally, the pupÃ¦ of <i>coleopterous</i><a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> and <i>hymenopterous</i>
insects; those of the <i>neuropterous</i> genera <i>Myrmeleon</i> and
<i>Hemerobius</i>, &amp;c.; the <i>Trichoptera</i>; amongst the <i>Diptera</i>,
<i>Culex</i>, <i>Tipula</i> L., <i>Tabanus</i>, <i>Bombylius</i>, &amp;c.; and that of the
flea (<i>Pulex</i>). These were the <i>incomplete</i> pupÃ¦ of LinnÃ©.</p>

<p>ii. Those pupÃ¦ in which the <i>parts</i> of the future insect,
being folded up under a harder skin, are <i>less</i> distinctly
<i>discoverable</i>. To this subdivision belong the pupÃ¦ of all
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, and of them alone. These are what LinnÃ©
termed <i>obtected</i> pupÃ¦.</p>

<p>iii. Those pupÃ¦ which are inclosed in the thick and
opaque skin of the larva, through which no <i>trace</i> of the
perfect insect can be <i>discovered</i>. These, which LinnÃ©
termed <i>coarctate</i> pupÃ¦, include a large proportion of the
<i>dipterous</i> genera; as <i>&#338;strus</i> L., <i>Musca</i> L., <i>Empis</i> L.,
<i>Conops</i> L., &amp;c. &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall next advert, chiefly to the pupÃ¦ of the grand
division last described, under the distinct heads of <i>substance</i>,
<i>figure</i>, and <i>parts</i>; <i>colour</i>, <i>age</i>, <i>sex</i>, <i>motions</i>, and
<i>extrication of the perfect insect</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>i. As to their <i>substance</i>&mdash;at first interiorly all pupÃ¦
consist of a milky fluid, in which the unformed members
of the future perfect insect may be said to float, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
which they may be discerned, and separated with the
point of a pin<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>. In proportion as these acquire consistency,
and are more and more developed by the absorption
of the surrounding fluid, they occupy its place, and
fill up the cavity of the puparium. The rest of this fluid
passes off by transpiration<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>. Reaumur is of opinion that
it is from the epiploon, or <i>corps graisseux</i>, that this matter
is prepared, which he regards as analogous to the white
of an egg<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>. In <i>coarctate</i> pupÃ¦ the included animal, or
the pulp that contains its germes (in which the limbs and
body at first are not discernible), fills at this period the
whole skin-cocoon; but in proportion as the above evaporation
takes place, and the consolidation of the body
and parts proceeds, it shrinks at each end, so that when
near assuming the imago, a considerable cavity appears
both at the head and tail of the cocoon<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>. At this period
of its existence, from the quantity of fluid included in the
puparium, the animal weighs usually considerably more
than it does when become a perfect insect<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>exterior</i> integument or <i>skin</i> of pupÃ¦, which is usually
lined with a very thin white pellicle, is of different
consistence in different orders. In the <i>Coleoptera</i> and
<i>Hymenoptera</i> it is, with a few exceptions, of a soft and
membranous texture; in the <i>Lepidoptera</i> (especially those
that are not defended by cocoons), and <i>Diptera</i>, it is more
rigid and harder, being either coriaceous or corneous.
Lepidopterous pupÃ¦, however, are not excluded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the last skin of the larvÃ¦ with this hard covering. At
the moment of this change the envelope is nearly as soft
and membranous as in the order first mentioned. But
they are besides covered with a viscous fluid, which appears
to ooze out, chiefly from under the wings, and
which very soon drying, forms the exterior hard shell<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>.
At first the antennÃ¦, wings, and legs, like those of <i>Coleoptera</i>
and <i>Hymenoptera</i>, can be each separated from the
body; and it is only after these parts have been glued together
by the fluid just mentioned, which takes place in
less than twenty-four hours<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>, that they are immoveably
attached to the body of the pupa, as we usually see them.
In fact, the essential difference between incomplete and
obtected pupÃ¦ seems to be, that in the former the limbs
and body are only covered each with a single membranous
integument, whereas in the latter they are besides glued
together by a substance which forms an additional and
harder envelope. It is not easy to explain the alteration
that takes place in the texture of the skin of such <i>dipterous</i>
pupÃ¦ as retain the skin of the larva. In the latter
this is generally a transparent and very fine membrane:
yet the very same integument becomes to the pupa an
opaque and rigid case.</p>

<p>The surface of the skin of the greater number of pupÃ¦
is smooth, but in those of many <i>PapilionidÃ¦</i> it is rugose
and warty: this you may see, particularly in that of <i>Papilio
Machaon</i>. In many of the hawkmoths (<i>Sphinx</i> L.)
it is covered with impressed puncta. In <i>Attacus Io</i> the
upper side of the channels that separate the intermediate
segments of the abdomen are curiously striated with transverse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
striÃ¦, formed of very minute granula, the lower side
being transversely sulcated. In some few instances, as
in <i>Arctia Salicis</i>, <i>Laria pudibunda</i> and <i>fascelina</i>, the skin
of the pupa is clothed with hair<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>: as is also that of <i>Hesperia
BixÃ¦</i>, according to Madame Merian<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>. De Geer
has described a little beetle under the name of <i>Tenebrio
lardarius (Latridius</i> Latr., <i>Corticaria</i> Marsh.), the pupa
of which is beset with very fine hairs, terminating in
a spherical or oval button<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>.</p>


<p>ii. I shall include under the same head both the <i>figure</i>
or shape, and <i>parts</i> of pupÃ¦, as the latter in most kinds
are either the same or nearly the same as those of the
larva, or merely incasing those of the imago, so as not to
require that detailed notice that I judged necessary when
treating of the parts of larvÃ¦.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>incomplete</i> pupÃ¦, nothing further can
be said of their extremely various <i>figure</i>, than that it has
a general resemblance to that of the perfect insect. The
head, trunk, abdomen, and their respective external organs,
are alike visible in both; but in the pupÃ¦, the latter,
instead of occupying their natural situation, are all closely
folded under the breast and abdomen: or, as in the case
of the long ovipositors of some Ichneumons, laid along the
back. In a specimen of some coleopterous insect now
before me, the following is the order of the arrangement
of the parts:&mdash;The head is inflexed; the mandibulÃ¦ are
open; between them are seen the labium and labial palpi;
these appear to cover and conceal the maxillÃ¦, and the
maxillary palpi extend on each side beyond them; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
antennÃ¦ pass above the thighs of the two anterior pair
of legs, and then turning down over the breast between
them and the posterior legs, repose upon the base of the
wings; which also are turned down between the intermediate
and posterior pair of legs, and rest upon the latter;
the tibiÃ¦ are bent in and folded upon the thigh,
and the tarsi turn outwards<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>. In another coleopterous
species, the wings and elytra are placed under the hind-legs.
In <i>Hymenopterous</i> pupÃ¦ the antennÃ¦ appear usually
to lie between the legs<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>. In many <i>TipulÃ¦</i> the long
legs are bent into three folds in the pupÃ¦; but the tarsi
are extended, and lie close to each other, the anterior
pair being the shortest<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>. In a specimen belonging to
this tribe in my cabinet, which I think contained <i>Ctenocera
pectinicornis</i>, the six leg-cases are of the same
length, exactly parallel and adjacent, and being annulated
wear the appearance of tracheÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>. These parts
have each their separate case, so that a pin may be introduced
between them and the body: which cases, as well
as the general envelope, are usually formed of a fine soft
transparent membrane; but sometimes, as in the lady-bird
(<i>Coccinella</i>), the tortoise-beetle (<i>Cassida</i>), the crane-fly
(<i>Tipula</i>), &amp;c. it is harder and more opaque, so that
though it is usually easy for a practised Entomologist
from an examination of the pupa, particularly in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
to predict to what genus the insect to be disclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
from them will belong, yet in these cases the organs
being not so conspicuous, a less experienced examiner
might be perplexed, and unable to come to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Although <i>hymenopterous</i> pupÃ¦ have usually no parts
but what are afterwards seen in the perfect insect, this is
not the case with several <i>coleopterous</i> and <i>dipterous</i> ones,
which are furnished with various temporary appendages,
indispensable to them to bring about their final change,
or for other purposes. Thus, the pupa of the male of
<i>Lucanus Cervus</i> has two short, jointed anal processes<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>.
That of <i>Hydrophilus caraboides</i> has a pedunculated lunulate
one; and moreover, the sides of the abdominal segments,
and the top of the thorax, are beset with hairs,
which are not seen in the perfect insect<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>. The abdomen
of many, also, is armed with spines. That, the arrangement
of whose organs I lately described, has a quadruple
series in the back of this part; viz. on each of the first five
segments, 3, 2, 2, 3. The five first ventral segments also
have on each side three spines; the inner are incurved, the
intermediate nearly upright, and the outer one recurved.
These spines, except those of the innermost ventral series,
terminate in a bristle. In another coleopterous species the
back part of the head is armed with a pair of lateral spines,
and that of the thorax with three processes, the external
ones armed with a single spine, and the intermediate one
with a pair. De Geer has figured the pupa of an <i>Asilus</i>,
the head of which is armed with eight spines&mdash;two robust
ones in front, and three smaller ones, connected at
the base on each side. The abdominal segments, also,
are fringed with spines<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>. The abdomen of the pupa of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
<i>Ctenocera pectinicornis</i> is armed with several strong conical
spines, pointing mostly towards the tail, which is
likewise the case with that of <i>Tipula lunata</i><a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>. As the
above pupÃ¦ are usually subterranean or subcortical, the
spines assist in pushing them out of the ground, &amp;c.
The respiratory horns that proceed from the thorax of
the pupÃ¦ of many of the aquatic gnats will be noticed
in another place. Those of <i>Corethra culiciformis</i> and of
some other aquatic gnat-like <i>Diptera</i>, have their anus
furnished with a pair of oars, or natatory laminÃ¦, by
which they rise to the surface<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>.</p>

<p>The figure of <i>obtected</i> pupÃ¦, or chrysalises, is more
uniform. They are commonly obtuse at the anterior extremity,
and gradually contracted to a point at the posterior,
or tail. The outline usually inclines to a long oval
or an ellipse; but in some, as <i>Attacus Io</i> and <i>Luna</i>, the
pupa is shorter and more spherical. In <i>Geometra sambucaria</i>
it represents an elongated cone, and in <i>Hepialus</i>
it is nearly cylindrical. In the butterfly tribe (<i>Papilio</i> L.)
the outline is frequently rendered angular by various protuberances.</p>

<p>In all these pupÃ¦ may be distinguished the following
parts:&mdash;<i>first</i>, the <i>Head-case</i> (<i>Cephalo-theca</i>), or anterior
extremity; <i>secondly</i>, the <i>Trunk-case</i> (<i>Cyto-theca</i>), or intermediate
part; and <i>thirdly</i>, the <i>Abdomen-case</i> (<i>Gastro-theca</i>).</p>

<p>1. The <i>Head-case</i> covers and protects the <i>head</i> of the
inclosed imago. From its sides behind proceed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
antennÃ¦-cases (<i>Cera-theca</i>); and before from the middle,
the tongue-case (<i>Glosso-theca</i>). Just below the base of the
antennÃ¦-case you may discern the eye-cases (<i>Ophthalmo-theca</i>),
surrounded on their inner side by a crescent-shaped
lÃ¦vigated piece, which may perhaps transmit
some light to the inclosed prisoner.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Trunk-case</i>, divided into the <i>thorax</i>, or <i>upper</i>
surface, extending from the head to the dorsal segments of
the abdomen, and consisting of three pieces, answering to
the <i>prothorax</i>, <i>mesothorax</i>, and <i>metathorax</i> of the perfect
insect: the first answering to the prothorax small, the
second covering the mesothorax very large, and the two
next representing the metathorax, at first appearing to
belong to the abdomen, but having no spiracle; and the
breast (<i>pectus</i>) or under-surface reaching from the head
to the ventral abdominal segments, from which proceed
the wing-cases (<i>Ptero-theca</i>) and leg-cases (<i>Podo-theca</i>),
which organs, with the antenna-cases and tongue-case,
entirely cover, or rather form, the breast. The arrangement
of the whole is as follows:&mdash;The wing-cases, which
are more or less triangular, and exhibit the larger nervures
of the wings, are a lateral continuation of the mesothorax,
which turn downwards from the sides of the
breast, and cover, or replace, the three first ventral segments
of the abdomen. The <i>antenna-cases</i>, united to the
anterior portion of the head just behind the eye-cases,
repose immediately next to those of the wings running
parallel with their inner margin. Then follow the legs,
the tibiÃ¦ forming an angle with the thigh, and the case
of the anterior pair being innermost, and representing the
breast-bone in the pupa. The tongue lies over the forelegs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
except in the case of some sphinxes, which I shall
notice afterwards: so that the glosso-theca covers both
them and it.</p>

<p>3. The abdomen-case consists of <i>nine</i> segments when
viewed on the back, and of only <i>six</i> when viewed below;
so that it might be said to have ten dorsal and six ventral
segments: but the fact is, that the place of the three
anterior ventral segments, or rather ventral portions of
the segments, (for they form complete rings without any
lateral suture,) are replaced by the wings and other organs:
in consequence of this, the fourth segment, which
is less covered than the three first, at its posterior margin
forms an annulus or ring. In counting the abdominal
segments of a pupa, you must be careful not to include
the piece that represents the <i>metathorax</i>, which looks as
if it belonged to the abdomen<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>. In the pupÃ¦ of <i>butterflies</i>
you will discover evident traces of <i>ten</i> dorsal segments;
but in many <i>moths</i>, and some <i>hawk-moths</i>, you
will perceive at first only <i>eight</i>, or even <i>seven</i>, but a closer
examination will enable you to discover the line that
marks out the others; and if you divide the puparium
longitudinally, and inspect its internal surface, you will
see very visible sutures between them. The intermediate
segments are sometimes separated from each other and
the preceding and subsequent ones by deep channels.
In the pupa of <i>Papilio Machaon</i> there is one such channel
between the third and fourth segments. In <i>Bombyx</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
<i>regalis</i> the channel is between the sixth and seventh, and
in <i>B. imperatoria</i> there are three, namely, a channel between
the third and fourth, and fourth and fifth, and fifth
and sixth segments. The way in which insects with an
exserted sting fold it in the pupa seems not to have been
noticed; but from an observation of De Geer upon one
species of <i>Ichneumon</i>, it appears to be turned up over the
back of the abdomen<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>.</p>

<p>These little animals, thus swathed and banded, exhibit
no unapt representation of an Egyptian mummy; though
Lamarck applies the term <i>Mumia</i> to <i>incomplete</i> pupÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>,
to which it seems less happily applicable.</p>

<p>Chrysalises, as to the modifications of their general
figure, may be conveniently divided into two great classes:
<i>first</i>, those that have no angular projections, the anal
mucro of some excepted, on different parts of their body;
and <i>secondly</i>, those which have such projections. Each
of these classes affords variations in its peculiar characters
which require to be noticed.</p>

<p>1. The first of these are called <i>angular</i> pupÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>, and
are confined to the <i>Butterfly</i> or diurnal tribes. In some
the head projects into one short conical protuberance:
this you may see in the chrysalis of the common cabbage
butterfly (<i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>), and others of the same genus<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>;
in the brimstone-butterfly (<i>Colias Rhamni</i><a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>), and
in the beautiful purple emperor or high-flier (<i>Apatura
Iris</i> F.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>): though in this last it is not conspicuous. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the most remarkable instance of a single eminence from
the head is exhibited by the pupa of a tropical butterfly
(<i>Morpho Idomeneus</i> Latr.), figured by Madame Merian.
In this the head projects into a long incurved obtuse
horn<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>. In others the head is armed with two mucros,
or conical eminences. This is the case with the common
butterfly of the nettle (<i>Vanessa UrticÃ¦</i> F.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>), and with that
of the beautiful <i>Papilio Machaon</i><a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>. In these the prominences
are trigonal. These processes, which in some, as
in the peacock-butterfly (<i>Vanessa Io</i>), stand upright<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>,
and in others diverge (<i>Papilio Machaon</i>), form the eye-cases
of the included imago; and in their outer base
is planted the crescent-shaped piece I lately mentioned,
which seems intended to convey light into it. In many
the prothorax, besides a lateral angular projection, has
in the middle another triangular or trigonal one, somewhat
resembling a Roman nose; on each side of which
is a smaller elevated black point: so that it requires no
great stretch of imagination to find out in it a sort of resemblance
to the human face, which, though not quite
so striking as honest Goedart figures it<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>, is however very
considerable. In the pupa of <i>Morpho Menelaus</i>, figured
by Madame Merian<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>, this nasiform prominence of the
prothorax is extended into a long arched horn, reaching
to the middle of the abdomen. The pupa of the silver-washed
fritillary (<i>Argynnis Paphia</i> F.), and others of the
same genus, exhibit beneath this nasiform prominence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
a very deep depression, itself beset with one or more series
of smaller angular elevations. The back of the abdomen
is often furnished with two rows of protuberances,
in some species larger, in others smaller<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>; sometimes
sharp and conical, and sometimes flat, and in some instances
resembling the fins of fishes<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>. These bosses
usually decrease in size towards the tail.</p>

<p>2. The second kind of chrysalises are denominated
<i>conical</i><a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>. These, which include the <i>crepuscular</i> and <i>nocturnal
Lepidoptera</i>, and the butterflies with <i>onisciform</i>
larvÃ¦, have no protuberances, and are less variable in
their form&mdash;their anterior extremity being almost constantly
oval and rounded, and their posterior conical and
acute. An exception to this form is met with in the pupa
of a moth long celebrated (<i>Lasiocampa Pithyocampa</i>)<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>,
which has the head acute and the tail obtuse, and armed
with two points<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>. Another occurs in that of the Cossus,
which has two points on the head, by which it makes
an opening in its cocoon: when it assumes the imago,
one of these is placed below the other<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>. And some
few have the anterior end nearly flat instead of rounded.
The pupa of the orange-tip butterfly (<i>Pieris Cardamines</i>)
seems intermediate between the angular and conical
kinds: it is somewhat boat-shaped, and distinguished
by a fusiform process from the head and tail<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>. Other
modifications of the usual figure are met with, but are
for the most part so slight as not to require notice. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
or two, however, should not be passed over. The pupÃ¦
of many hawk-moths (<i>Sphinx</i> L.) have the anterior piece
of the head-case elongated into a sort of cylindrical proboscis,
which is incurved beneath the breast: you will
find this formation in <i>S. Convolvuli</i> and <i>Ligustri</i><a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>. In
some, as in a species figured by Madame Merian, that
feeds upon the <i>Annona squamosa</i>, it is rolled up like a
serpent in many folds<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>. In <i>Noctua LinariÃ¦</i> the tongue-case
turns upwards, and is prominent laterally beyond
the body<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>. This singular appendage is one of those
beautiful instances of compensating contrivances, as Dr.
Paley calls them, which perpetually occur in the insect
tribes. The tongue of these hawk-moths is of very great
length, often three inches, while the pupa itself is scarcely
two; it could not possibly, therefore, have been extended
at length, as it is in common cases, but is coiled up
within the above protuberance. When the tongue is but
a little longer than the breast, the ordinary plan is adhered
to, but the apex of the breast projects a little over
the abdomen into a sort of nose, in which the end of the
tongue is contained. This conformation may be seen in
the pupa of <i>Noctua Gamma</i>, <i>Verbasci</i>, and many other
species. Sometimes, as in <i>N. LinariÃ¦</i> F., this projection
is recurved into a short horn.</p>

<p>I have before adverted to the <i>adminicula</i> or short spines
looking towards the anus, with which the dorsal segments
of the abdomen of some pupÃ¦ are armed; and by which,
when the time for their exclusion is arrived, they are
enabled to push themselves upwards or outwards from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
their several places of confinement<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>: you will find these
in the pupa of the great goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>);
and in the cylindrical pupa of the moth called the ghost
(<i>Hepialus Humuli</i> F.) there are two rows of sharp triangular
spines on the back of each segment. These are not
laid flat, but, as they do also in the <i>Cossus</i>, form an acute
angle with the body; which gives them greater power of
resistance. Those that constitute the row nearest the
base of the segment are longer than the anterior row,
the middle spines than the lateral ones. The first and
last segment are without them, and the last segment but
one has a sharp ventral transverse ridge, armed with
many sharp teeth<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>. The abdominal spines lately mentioned,
of semicomplete pupÃ¦, are also <i>adminicula</i>.</p>

<p>The tail of this description of pupÃ¦ is in many instances
armed with a mucro, or sharp point, emerging
from its upper side. You will see this in most hawk-moths.
In the pupa of <i>Hesperia Proteus</i> the mucro is
truncate at the apex; in that of <i>Bombyx imperatoria</i> it is
long, and terminates in two diverging points. In the
majority of chrysalises of both descriptions the tail is
acute, and usually furnished with hooks of different kinds.
These are so various in shape and number, &amp;c. that they
would probably afford good characters for discriminating
many allied species. In some there are but two or three,
in others five or six, in others they are more numerous<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>.
Sometimes they are quite straight<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>, but most commonly
recurved, so as to form a hook. The hawk-moths, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
few others, as <i>Bombyx Pini</i>, <i>Cerura Vinula</i>, &amp;c., have no
anal hooks whatever. Under this head I shall observe,
that in many conical pupÃ¦ below the anal angle or mucro,
is the appearance of a vertical foramen or passage:
this is particularly conspicuous in <i>Hepialus</i>, in which it
is surmounted by a bifid ridge, and has under it a pair of
minute black tubercles.</p>

<p>A pretty accurate judgement of the division to which
the perfect insect when disclosed will belong, may usually
be formed from the figure of its <i>chrysalis</i>. All the <i>angular</i>
ones, with scarcely any exception, inclose <i>butterflies</i>.
The converse, however, does not hold; for some that are
not angular, as those of <i>Parnassius Apollo</i> and <i>Mnemosyne</i>,
and most of the Linnean <i>Plebeii urbicolÃ¦</i>, also
inclose flies of that description. With these exceptions,
all <i>conical</i> chrysalises give birth to <i>moths</i> or <i>hawkmoths</i>.
An idea even of the family or genus under which the
perfect insect will arrange, may be generally formed from
the figure of the chrysalis; less distinctly, however, in
the conical or rounded, than in the angular kinds, in
which the prominences of the head and trunk, as before
explained, usually vary in different families. Even the
sex of some moths may be judged from the pupÃ¦: those
of females being thicker; and those also of the females that
have no wings, or only the rudiments of them, will of
course vary somewhat from the ordinary form: but there
is a still more striking difference in that of <i>Callimorpha?
vestita</i> F., and others of the singular tribe before noticed<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>,
called by the Germans <i>Sacktrager</i> (sack-bearers),
from the sack-like cases in which the larva resides. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
females of these having not only no wings, but no antennÃ¦,
and legs not longer than those of the larva, their
pupa more resembles that of a <i>dipterous</i> than of a <i>lepidopterous</i>
insect, it being not easy to determine which is
the head and which the tail<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>.</p>

<p>In these too we can often learn from the outline of the
wing-cases, whether the inhabitant of the chrysalis has
these organs indented or intire. If the former, the margins
of these cases are sinuate, as in that of <i>Vanessa
C. album</i>; if the latter, they are intire, as in <i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>.
Even in conical pupÃ¦,&mdash;the size, the shape of the
antennÃ¦, which may be distinguished through the skin
that covers them, and slight modifications of the ordinary
form,&mdash;give indications of the genus of the included
insect sufficiently conclusive to a practised eye.</p>

<p>The true figure of <i>coarctate</i> pupÃ¦ when they are mature,
the parts of the future fly being very visible, and
each being included in a separate case<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>, is that of those
that belong to the <i>incomplete</i> division; but as this is a
character not cognizable without dissection, it is customary,
in speaking of pupÃ¦ of this description, to refer solely to
the shape of the exterior covering, which is in fact a cocoon
formed of the dried skin of the larva moulded into a different
form. In this sense the figure of coarctate pupÃ¦ is
extremely various. The majority of them are more or less
oval or elliptical, without any distinct parts, were it not
that they usually retain traces of the segments which composed
the larva's body<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>. Of this figure are the pupÃ¦ of the
common cheese-maggot<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>, and many other flies. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
(<i>Sepedon</i> Latr.) have the pupa shaped like a boat. That
of <i>ScÃ¦va Pyrastri</i> F. assumes the figure of a flask; or,
according to Reaumur's more accurate comparison, of a
<i>tear</i><a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>. The tail of many of these pupÃ¦, particularly of
aquatic species, is elongated into a sort of beak, either
simple or forked, or is beset with spines variously arranged.
The pupa of <i>Stratyomis ChamÃ¦leon</i>, and other
allied species, differs from all the rest of this subdivision
in retaining the exact form of the larva<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>; and hence constitutes
an exception to the general character of our second
great Division.</p>


<p>iii. There is much less variety in the <i>colour</i> of pupÃ¦
than in that of larvÃ¦. The majority of coleopterous and
hymenopterous pupÃ¦ are white, or whitish; of lepidopterous
and dipterous, brown of various shades, often
verging on black in the former and on red in the latter.
The angular lepidopterous ones, however, are more
gaily decorated. Some, <i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>, are of a greenish
yellow, marked with spots of black; others are of a uniform
green, <i>Apatura Iris</i>, <i>Pieris Cardamines</i>; others, reddish,
<i>Vanessa C. album</i>; others again red with black
spots, <i>Urania Leilus</i><a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>. A still greater number shine as
though gilded with burnished gold&mdash;either applied in
partial streaks, <i>Vanessa Cardui</i>; or covering the entire
surface, <i>Vanessa UrticÃ¦</i>. It was from this gilded appearance
in some <i>obtected</i> pupÃ¦ that the terms <i>Chrysalis</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
<i>Aurelia</i> were applied to the whole. The alchemists mistook
this for real gold; and referred to the case as an
argument in favour of the transmutation of metals. But
Reaumur has satisfactorily shown, that in this instance
the old proverb is strictly applicable&mdash;"All is not gold
that glitters." He found that this appearance is owing
to the shining white membrane immediately below the
outer skin, which being of a transparent yellow gives a
golden tinge to the former; in the same way that tinfoil,
when covered with a yellow varnish, assumes the metallic
appearance which we see in gilt leather. He mentions,
too, that for the production of this effect&mdash;it is essential
that the inner membrane be moist: whence may be explained
the disappearance of the gilding as soon as the
butterfly is ready to escape from the pupa. The shade
of colour in these gilded chrysalises is various: some are
of a rich yellow, like pure gold; others much paler; and
some nearly as white as silver. That of <i>Hipparchia
CassiÃ¦</i> F. is red with silver spots<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>.</p>

<p>Though by far the greater number of the chrysalises
of moths are of an uniform chestnut, brown, or black,&mdash;a
few are of other colours; as that of <i>Geometra alniaria</i>,
which is of a glaucous blue; of <i>Noctua sponsa</i>, lilac; and
of <i>Noctua pacta</i>, of a lovely blue, caused by a kind of
bloom, like that of a plum, spread upon a brown ground.
A similar bloom is found on that of <i>Parnassius Apollo</i>,
and on the anterior part of that of <i>Platypterix cultaria</i>
and <i>sicula</i>; in which last, Kliemann observed it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
be renewed when rubbed off<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> Many pupÃ¦ have the
sheaths of the wings of a different colour from that of the
rest of the body; a few are variegated with paler streaks
or bands, as <i>Clostera Anastomosis</i>, which has two red
longitudinal stripes down its dark-brown back; and that
of the common gooseberry and currant moth, which may
be found in every garden, has alternate rings of black
and yellow<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>.</p>

<p>A few pupÃ¦ vary in their colour, as the painted lady-butterfly
(<i>Vanessa Cardui</i>), some of which are light-brown
with gray streaks and golden dots, others wholly of a
golden yellow or brown, others of a light green<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>.</p>

<p>Almost all at their first assumption of the pupa state
have a different colour from that which they take a few
days afterwards. This last they retain until the disclosure
of the perfect insect; except some that have transparent
skins, which a few days previously to this period
exhibit the colours of the included animal.</p>


<p>iv. There is as great variety in the length of the <i>age</i>
of Insects in their pupa as in their larva state. Some
species continue in it only <i>two</i> or <i>three days</i> (<i>Aleyrodes
Chelidonii</i> Latr., <i>Tinea proletella</i> L.); others, as many
<i>weeks</i>, or <i>months</i>, or even <i>years</i>. Each, however, has in
general a stated period, which in ordinary circumstances
it neither much exceeds nor falls short of. The only
general rule that can be laid down is&mdash;that <i>small</i> pupÃ¦
continue in that state a shorter time than those of <i>larger</i>
bulk. Thus, amongst coleopterous genera, the more minute
species of <i>Curculio</i> L.; amongst the <i>Hymenoptera</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the <i>Ichneumones minuti</i> L.; amongst the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the
subcutaneous tribes; and the majority of the <i>Diptera</i>,&mdash;remain
as pupÃ¦ only a few days or weeks: while the
larger species in all these orders commonly exist in the
same state several months&mdash;many even upwards of <i>two</i>
years. There are, however, numerous exceptions to
this rule; for some large pupÃ¦ are disclosed in a much
shorter time than some others not a twentieth part of
their bulk.</p>

<p>The reasons both of the rule and of the exceptions to
it are sufficiently obvious. And first, as to the rule:&mdash;If
you open a pupa soon after its assumption of that state,
you will find its interior filled with a milky fluid, in the
midst of which the rudiments of its future limbs and organs,
themselves almost as fluid, swim. Now the end to
be accomplished during the pupa's existence is, the gradual
evaporation of the watery parts of this fluid, and the
development of the organs of the inclosed animal by the
absorption and assimilation of the residuum. Reaumur,
by inclosing a pupa in a stopped glass tube, collected a
quantity of clear and apparently of pure water, equal to
eight or ten large drops, which had evaporated from it,
and was condensed against the sides of the tube, and it
was found to have lost an eighteenth part of its weight<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>.
It is plain, therefore, that this necessary transpiration,
other circumstances being alike, must take place sooner
in a <i>small</i> than in a <i>large</i> pupa. Next, as to the exceptions:&mdash;Since
the more speedy or more tardy evaporation
of fluids depends upon their exposure to a greater or less
degree of heat, we might <i>Ã  priori</i> conclude, that pupÃ¦<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
exposed to a high temperature would sooner attain maturity,
even though larger in bulk, than others exposed
to a low one:&mdash;and this is the fact. The pupa of a large
moth, which has assumed that state in the early part of
summer, will often disclose the perfect insect in twelve or
fourteen days; while that of an Ichneumon, not one hundredth
part of its size, that did not enter this state till
late in autumn, will not appear as a fly for seven or eight
months. But this is not the whole. The very same insect,
according as it has become a pupa at an earlier or
later period of the year, will at one time live but a few
weeks, at another several months, in that state. Thus,
if the caterpillar of <i>Papilio Machaon</i>, one of those which
has annually a double brood, becomes a pupa in July,
the butterfly will appear in <i>thirteen days</i>: if not until
September, it will not make its appearance until the June
following; that is, not in less than <i>nine</i> or <i>ten months</i>:
and the case is the same with the pupÃ¦ of <i>Noctua Psi</i>,
and of a vast number of other insects. To put beyond
all doubt the dependence of these remarkable variations
on temperature merely, it was only necessary that they
should be effected, as Lister long ago advised<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>, by artificial
means. This Reaumur accomplished. In the
month of January he placed the chrysalises of several
moths and butterflies, which would not naturally have
been disclosed until the following May, in a hothouse:
the result was, that the perfect insects made their appearance
in less than a fortnight, in the very depth of winter;
and by other numerous and varied experiments he ascertained,
that in this heated atmosphere five or six <i>days</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
hastened their maturity more than as many <i>weeks</i> would
have done in the open air. The disclosed insects were
in every respect perfect, and the females, after pairing,
laid their eggs, and then died, just as if they had not
been thus prematurely forced into existence. The converse
of this experiment equally succeeded:&mdash;by keeping
pupÃ¦ the whole summer in an icehouse, Reaumur caused
them to produce the fly one full year later than their ordinary
period<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.</p>

<p>This extraordinary fact leads us to a very singular and
unexpected conclusion&mdash;that we have the power of
lengthening or shortening the life of many insects at
pleasure; that we can cause one individual to live more
than twice as long as another of the same species, and
<i>vice versÃ¢</i>. Had Paracelsus made this discovery, it would
have led him to pursue his researches after the elixir of
immortality with redoubled confidence, and would have
supplied him with an argument for the possibility of prolonging
the life of man beyond its usual term, which his
sceptical opponents would have found some difficulty in
rebutting. Even the logical Reaumur seems inclined to
infer from it, that this object of the alchemists was not so
chimerical as we are wont to conclude<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>. He confesses,
however, if it were to be attained only by the same process
as effects the extension of an insect's life&mdash;by prolonging
its state of torpor and insensibility,&mdash;that few
would choose to enjoy it on such conditions. The man
of pleasure, blunted by excess of use to all modern stimuli,
might perhaps not object to a sleep of a hundred
years, in the hope of finding something new under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
sun when he waked; and an ardent astronomer would
probably commit himself with scientific joy to a repose as
long and as sound as that of the seven sleepers, for the
chance of viewing his predicted return of a comet, on
stepping out of his cave: but ordinary mortals would
consign themselves to the perils of so long a night with
reluctance, apprehending a fate no better than what befel
the magician, who ordered himself to be cut in small
pieces and put in pickle, with the expectation of becoming
young again<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>.</p>

<p>The duration, then, of an insect's existence in the
pupa state, depends upon its bulk, upon the temperature
to which it is exposed, and upon a combination of these
two circumstances. This experiment appears very simple.
We seem to ourselves to have accomplished what is
so often undertaken in vain&mdash;to have found an entrance
into the cabinet of Nature, and to have made ourselves
masters of the contents of one of the pages of her sealed
and secret book. We deceive, ourselves, however: this
book, when it seems most legible, is often interlined with
<i>sympathetic inks</i>, if I may so speak, which require tests
unknown to us for their detection. If you lay up a considerable
number of the pupÃ¦ of a moth now called <i>Eriogaster
lanestris</i>, the larva of which is not uncommon in
June on the black-thorn, selected precisely of the same
size, and exposed to exactly the same temperature, the
greater number of them will disclose the perfect insect
in the February following; some not till the February of
the year ensuing, and the remainder not before the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
month in the third year<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>. Mr. Jones of Chelsea, a most
acute lepidopterist, in one of his excursions captured a
female of <i>Arctia mendica</i>, another moth, which laid a
number of eggs, thirty-six of which produced caterpillars:
all these fed, spun their cocoons, and went into the
pupa state in the usual manner, but at the proper season
only twelve produced the fly. As this was no uncommon
circumstance, he concluded that the rest were dead: to
his great astonishment, however, in the next season twelve
more made their appearance; and the following year the
remainder burst into life, equally perfect with the foregoing<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>.
In this extraordinary result, which also occasionally
has been observed to take place in the emperor-moth
(<i>Saturnia pavonia</i>), the privet-hawkmoth (<i>Sphinx
Ligustri</i>), and that of the spurge (<i>S. EuphorbiÃ¦</i>)<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>, and
other species,&mdash;it is clear that something besides mere size
and temperature is concerned: for, these circumstances
being precisely alike, one pupa arrives at maturity in six
months, and another of the same brood requires between
two and three years. We can guess, that the end which
the All-wise Creator has in view, in causing this remarkable
difference, is the prevention of all possibility of the
destruction of the species. <i>Eriogaster lanestris</i> and <i>Arctia
mendica</i>, &amp;c., for instance, are doomed, for some reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
unknown to us<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>, to be disclosed from the pupa in
the cold and stormy months of February and March,
almost every day of which in certain years is so ungenial
that few insects could then survive exposure, much less
deposit their eggs and ensure the succession of a progeny.
Now, were all these to make their appearance in the perfect
state in the <i>same</i> year, it might happen that the
whole race in a particular district would be destroyed.
But this possibility is effectually guarded against by the
beautiful provision under consideration, it being very improbable
that three successive seasons should be throughout
unfavourable; and without such occurrence, it is clear
that some of the race of this moth will be preserved. In
the case of other moths, whose pupÃ¦ though disclosed in
the summer are governed by the same rule, the prevention
of the extinction of the species, by any extraordinary increase
in a particular year of their natural enemies, seems
the object in view<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>. But though the intention be thus
obvious, the means by which it is effected are impenetrably
concealed. What physiologist would not be puzzled
with the eggs of a bird, of which one-third should
require for their hatching to be sat upon only a fortnight,
another third a month, and the remainder six weeks? Yet
this would be an anomaly exactly analogous to that observed
by Mr. Jones with respect to the pupÃ¦ of <i>A. mendica</i>.
Reaumur found that when the skin of pupÃ¦ was
varnished, so as to prevent absorption, the appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the fly happened nearly two months later than in ordinary
circumstances. Are we to conjecture that those of
the moth just mentioned, or of <i>E. lanestris</i>, that are latest
matured, from a greater degree of viscidity in the
fluid that forms them<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>, have thicker and more impervious
skins than those disclosed at an earlier period?
Or are we to refer the difference to some unknown peculiarity
of organization? On any supposition, the fact
remains equally wonderful; and I know of none the illustration
of which is more worthy of the patient investigation
of the physiologist.</p>

<p>As the period of maturity of the perfect insect is thus
in some cases not fixed even to years, and as in many
it seems dependent upon such variable causes; nothing
appears more improbable than that it should ever be
so strictly determined, that even the week in which the
fly will leave its pupa-case can be pretty accurately predicted.
Such, however, is the fact with regard to the
<i>Ephemera</i> so interestingly described by Reaumur, the
myriads of which that issue from the banks of the Seine
all appear in two or three days, somewhere between the
10th and 18th of the month of August<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> in every year;
at which time the fishermen regularly expect them. A
like regularity attends the appearance of those described
by Swammerdam, which every year, for three days about
the feast of St. John, issue in clouds from the Rhine<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>&mdash;Not
only is the week fixed, but in several instances even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the hour. The EphemerÃ¦ observed by Reaumur appear
at no other time than between <i>eight</i> and <i>ten</i> o'clock in
the <i>evening</i>; and so unalterably is their exclusion fixed,
that neither cold nor rain can retard it. Between these
hours, in the evenings on which they appear, you may
see them fill the air, but an hour before or after, you will
in vain look for one<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>. So also the silkworm-moth and
the hawkmoth of the evening primrose (<i>Sphinx &#338;notherÃ¦</i>)
constantly break forth from the pupa at <i>sunrise</i>:
and the hawkmoth of the lime (<i>Smerinthus TiliÃ¦</i>) as certainly
at <i>noon</i><a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>. Schroeter states, that of sixteen specimens
of the death's-head-hawkmoth (<i>S. Atropos</i>) which
he bred, every one was disclosed between <i>four</i> and <i>seven</i>
o'clock in the <i>afternoon</i><a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this head, I must observe, that after
a caterpillar or gnat has spun its cocoon, it sometimes
remains for a considerable period before it incloses itself
in the pupa-case, and casts off the form of a larva. Thus
the little parasite (<i>Ichneumon glomeratus</i> L.) that destroys
the caterpillar of the common cabbage-butterfly, remains
a larva in its cocoon for many months, but it becomes a
perfect insect a few days after it has put on its puparium<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>;
and the caterpillars of the great goat-moth (<i>Cossus
ligniperda</i>), if they spin their cocoon in the autumn,
remain in it through the winter in the larva state;
whereas, if they inclose themselves in the month of June,
they assume the pupa, so as to appear as flies in three or
four weeks<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>. It is not therefore easy to state precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the age of those pupÃ¦ which are produced from larvÃ¦
that spin cocoons.</p>


<p>v. I have not much to say with regard to the <i>sex</i> of
pupÃ¦. The male is probably to be distinguished from
the female by being smaller; but in the first great division
of pupÃ¦, those which resemble the larvÃ¦, and are
locomotive, the female in numerous cases may be known
by the Ovipositor, or instrument for depositing her eggs
in their proper station: and the male also has his anal
instruments. Sometimes in this state the animal is so
matured, as to be capable of continuing its kind. I have
found the pupÃ¦ both of a <i>Gryllus</i> L. and of a <i>Cimex</i> L.
<i>in coitu</i>.</p>


<p>vi. Though the pupÃ¦ of the second great division are
usually not locomotive, yet I must not omit some notice
of their <i>motions</i>. As the legs of insects in this state are
folded within a common or partial integument, of course
none of the pupÃ¦ now under consideration, with the exception
of those of the <i>Trichoptera</i> order, can walk: <i>coarctate</i>
ones are even incapable of the slightest motion,
and exhibit no symptom whatever of animation. Some
of those that are termed <i>incomplete</i>, however, and most
chrysalises, have the power of communicating to their
bodies a slight movement, extending more or less in different
species, which is effected by the abdominal segments
solely. The latter, during the first twelve hours
of being pupÃ¦, when their skin is soft, frequently turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
themselves, that the side on which they lie may not be
flattened; afterwards by far the majority merely wriggle
or twist their abdomen when touched, or in any way incommoded
or disturbed. We learn from De Geer, that
the pupa of the ghost-moth (<i>Hepialus Humuli</i>), the cocoon
of which is more than twice the length of the chrysalis,
moves in it from one end to the other<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>. Bonnet
observed one of a moth (perhaps <i>Lasiocampa Quercus</i>),
which alternately fixed itself at the top and bottom of its
spacious and obliquely-fixed cocoon; descending slowly,
but ascending as quickly, and almost in the same manner,
as a chimney-sweeper in a chimney<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>. The pupa of the
weevil of the water-hemlock (<i>Lixus paraplecticus</i>) will
move from one end of the interior of a branch to another
by means of its <i>adminicula</i>, aided by the motion of its
abdominal segments<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>. But the most locomotive of pupÃ¦
of the second division are those of gnats, and many
Tipulidans, which pass this state in the water. These
will move from the bottom to the surface, and back again,
with great facility and velocity. I have before mentioned
several other motions of pupÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>, which I shall not repeat
here, by which they extricate themselves from their several
places of intermediate repose, before they leave the
puparium: if the imago were to be disclosed in the interior
of a tree, or in the earth, its wings would be materially
injured in forcing its way out. The object of
several of the above motions may be to alarm insects that
might attack these defenceless beings. The twirling motion
in particular, formerly noticed<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>, in some species, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
causing a rustling against the sides of the cocoon, makes
a considerable noise&mdash;so singular in that of a red underwing-moth
(<i>Noctua pacta</i>), that RÃ¶sel tells us, (who by
the by was more timid than becomes a philosopher,) that
the first time he heard it, he had nearly thrown away the
box that contained it, in his fright<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>.</p>


<p>vii. We are next to consider <i>The extrication of the perfect
insect from the puparium, or pupa-case, and from the
cocoon</i>. The period when the pupa has attained maturity,
and the inclosed insect is ready to burst the walls of
its prison, may be often ascertained. Just at this time
the colour frequently undergoes an alteration, the golden
or silver tint of the gilded chrysalises vanishes; and those
which are transparent, usually permit the form and colours
of the insect within and the motions of their limbs
to be distinctly seen through them. In the <i>Libellulina</i>
the eyes become more brilliant<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>. The mature pupÃ¦ of
the moth lately mentioned (<i>Eriogaster lanestris</i>) have a
particular swell of the abdominal segments, not apparent
in those that are to continue till another season, or
longer<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>. Those of the case-worms (<i>Trichoptera</i>) push
off the grates from the cases which they have hitherto
inhabited, and swim about<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>. Other signs and motions
doubtless predict the approach of this great change in
other species, which have not been recorded.</p>

<p>The mode in which insects make their way out of the
<i>puparium</i> differs in different orders. In <i>obtected</i> pupÃ¦,
the struggles of the included butterfly or moth first effect
a longitudinal slit down the middle of the thorax, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
there is usually a suture for the purpose. The slit rapidly
extends along the head, and down the parts which
compose the breast, and the insect gradually withdraws
itself from its case. It is not, however, from the outer
skin merely that it has to disengage itself, but also from
a series of inner membranous cases, which separately inclose
the antennÃ¦, proboscis, feet, &amp;c., as a glove does
the fingers; and similar cases inclose the parts of the
perfect insect in pupÃ¦ of all the other orders. This is
sometimes a work of difficulty, but ordinarily it is effected
with ease.</p>

<p><i>Incomplete</i> and <i>semicomplete</i> pupÃ¦ undergo nearly the
same process, save that in them the body is not swathed
up in a common case; and therefore they have only to
liberate themselves from the partial cases that envelop the
several parts of their body.</p>

<p>In <i>coarctate</i> pupÃ¦, as those of <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, <i>SyrphidÃ¦</i>,
<i>&#338;stridÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., the process is different. Their outer-case
is ordinarily more rigid and destitute of the sutures,
which in the former tribes so easily yield to a slight effort.
Yet in these, at the anterior end under which the head of
the fly lies, and from which it always issues, there is
commonly a sort of lid, joined by a very indistinct suture
to the rest, which can be pushed off, leaving a sufficient
opening for the egress of the insect. In the pupÃ¦ of
many of this tribe this lid is composed of two semicircular
pieces, which can be separately removed. Many
species seem to be able to force off the lid of their puparium,
by merely pushing against it with their heads:
but the common flesh-fly and many other <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, which
are perhaps too feeble to effect this, or whose puparia
are stronger than ordinary, are furnished with a very remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
apparatus for this express and apparently sole
purpose. They are gifted with the power of introducing
<i>air</i> under the middle part of the head, to which the antennÃ¦
are fixed, and of inflating that part into a sort of
membranous vesicle as big as the head itself; by the action
of which against the end of the pupa-case, the lid is soon
forced off. So powerful is this singular lever, that it is
even sufficient to rupture the fibrous galls in which the
pupÃ¦ of the gay-winged <i>Tephritis Cardui</i><a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> are inclosed.
That it is designed by Creative Wisdom to answer this
sole purpose seems proved, from its disappearing soon
after the disclosure of the fly, whose head shortly becomes
all alike hard. Reaumur suspects that it may also be
intended to promote the circulation of the insect's fluids;
but to me his reasons appear not conclusive<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>. In one
instance a mode still more unexpected obtains. The illustrious
naturalist just named found that the fly which
proceeded from one of the rat-tailed grubs (<i>Elophilus</i>
Latr.) had actually the power of completely reversing its
situation in its narrow case; and that it then employed its
<i>tail</i> in pushing off the lid, which other species remove by
means of their <i>heads</i><a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>.</p>

<p>The extrication of insects whose pupÃ¦ are above
ground, like those of butterflies, many beetles, flies, &amp;c.,
is comparatively a simple operation. But what, you will
ask, becomes of those species whose pupÃ¦ are concealed
deep in the earth, or in the heart of the trees on which
their larvÃ¦ have fed? Of this you shall be informed.&mdash;<i>Coleopterous</i>
insects disclosed from pupÃ¦ thus circumstanced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
wait until their organs have acquired strength,
and their elytra are sufficiently hardened to protect their
filmy wings from damage in forcing their way through
the earth or wood which covers them. Thus <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>,
a rhinoceros beetle common on the Continent, is
a full <i>month</i> before it reaches the surface of the earth,
after quitting its puparium. But it is evident that no
delay would enable <i>lepidopterous</i> or <i>dipterous</i> insects,
which are without elytra, to make their way out of such
situations, without irreparable injury to their delicate
wings. Many of these, therefore, while still within the
hard case of the pupa, have the precaution, a few days
previously to their exclusion, to force themselves up to
the surface of the earth, or, when they reside in the interior
of trees, to the entrance of their hole. This is effected
by a successive wriggling of the abdominal segments,
which in several species, of the <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
and <i>Diptera</i> orders, for this purpose, as has
been more than once observed<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>, are furnished with
sharp points (<i>adminicula</i>), admitting a progressive, but
not a retrograde motion. The puparia of the great goat-moth
(<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) may be often seen projecting
from orifices in willow-trees; and those of the common
crane-fly (<i>Tipula oleracea</i>) from the surface of the earth,
to which they have thus made their way from a depth of
several inches.</p>

<p>In all the preceding instances the exclusion of the perfect
insect is complete, as soon as it has withdrawn itself
from the puparium. But to a very large number, even
after this is effected, the arduous task still remains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
piercing the cocoons of leaves, of thick silk, of tough gum,
or even of wood, in which the pupÃ¦ are incased. We
can readily conceive how the strong jaws of <i>coleopterous</i>
and <i>hymenopterous</i> species may be employed to release
them from their confinement. But what instruments can
be used for this purpose by <i>moths</i> in a state of great debility,
whose mouth has nothing like jaws&mdash;merely a soft
membranous proboscis? How shall the silkworm-moth
(<i>B. Mori</i>) force its way through the close texture of a silken
ball, through which the finger could not be easily pushed?
Or the puss-moth (<i>Cerura Vinula</i>) pierce the walls of
its house of glue and wood, which scarcely yield to the
knife? You will not doubt that these difficulties have been
foreseen by <span class="smcap">Infinite Wisdom</span>, and provided against by
<span class="smcap">Infinite Power</span>. The egress of moths from their cocoons
is secured in two ways;&mdash;either by some peculiarity
in the first construction of the cocoon by the caterpillar,
or by some process which the pupa or perfect insect is
instructed to perform. As examples of each, several curious
instances may be cited.</p>

<p>The larva of the moth which about 1760 made such
havoc in the province of Angoumois in France, becomes
a pupa in the interior of the grain of wheat which it has
excavated; but the opening by which it first entered is
not bigger than a pin's point, and is quite insufficient for
the egress of the moth. How, then, is the latter to force
its way through the tough skin which surrounds it? The
larva, previously to assuming the pupa state, gnaws out a
little circular piece at that end of the grain where the head
of the future moth would lie, taking care not to detach it
entirely. At this little door, which is sufficient to protect
it from intruders, the moth has but to push, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
falls down, and leaves a free passage for its exit. A
contrivance almost similar is adopted by a caterpillar
which feeds in the interior of the heads of a species of
teazel (<i>Dipsacus</i> L.), for a minute and interesting history
of which we are indebted to Bonnet. This caterpillar
previously to its metamorphosis actually cuts a circular
opening in the head, sufficiently large for the egress of the
future moth; but to secure this sally-port during its long
sleep, it artfully closes it with fibres of the teazel, closely
but not strongly glued together<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>. Another small caterpillar
described by the same author, resides in the leaf of
an ash curiously rolled up into a cone, and then assumes
the pupa, which is inclosed in a silken cocoon, ingeniously
suspended by two threads like a hammock in the
middle of its habitation, and of so slight a texture that
it presents no obstacle to the extrication of the moth.
It is the closely-joined sides of its leafy dwelling that form
a barrier, which, were it not for the precaution of the
larva, would be impenetrable to so small and weak an
animal. The little provident creature, before its change
to a pupa, gnaws in the leaf a round opening, taking
care not to cut through the exterior epidermis. This
door is to serve the moth for its exit, like that formed by
the wheat-caterpillar. But in proportion to its bulk its
verdant apartment is of considerable size. How then
shall the moth know the exact place where its outlet has
been traced? How, without a clue, shall it discover in
its dark abode the precise circle which requires only a
push to throw it down? Even this is foreseen and provided
against. Out of twenty positions in which its hammock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
might have been slung, the caterpillar has been directed
so to place it, that the silken cord that suspends
the head is fastened close to the side of the door which it
has previously constructed; and the moth, guided by this
<i>filum ariadneum</i>, at once makes its way out of an apartment
which, but for this contrivance, might have been to
it a labyrinth as inextricable as that of Minos<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>.</p>

<p>The mode in which other caterpillars provide for their
extrication, when become moths, from their silken cocoons,
is not less ingenious. Those of <i>Eriogaster lanestris</i>
(of which I have lately said so much,) and others, form
oblong cocoons, which, viewed externally, you would at
the first glance assert were of one solid piece: but on
examining them more narrowly, you perceive one end of
them to be a distinct lid, of a size large enough to permit
the moth to issue out; and that it is kept in its place
by a few slight threads, easily broken by pressure from
within<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>. A few pages back<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> I mentioned a cocoon formed
by the larva of <i>Tortrix prasinana</i>, of the shape of a
boat reversed, composed of two inclined walls fastened
together at the top and ends. In constructing this cocoon,
it firmly glues to each other the top and one end, so as to
form an impermeable suture; but the other end, at which
the moth is to issue, though externally it seems as strong
as the rest, is merely drawn close by a slender thread or
two fastened on the inside, and easily broken from within.
And, what is particularly singular in the construction of
this ingenious habitation, the sides forming the end last
mentioned, though originally requiring force to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
them into their required position, become so elastic as to
close again when the moth has passed between them and
made her escape; the cocoon preserving its usual shape,
even when deprived of its inhabitant<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>. A similar cocoon
is constructed by another leaf-rolling caterpillar, that of
<i>Tortrix chlorana</i><a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>. Many similar proofs of contrivance
in the construction of silken cocoons might be adduced,
but I shall confine myself to one more only&mdash;I mean that
furnished by the flask-shaped brown one of <i>Saturnia Pavonia</i>,
and some other moths. If you examine one of
these cocoons, which are common enough in some places
on the pear-tree or the willow, you will perceive that it
is generally of a solid tissue of layers of silk almost of
the texture of parchment; but at the narrow end, or
that which may be compared to the neck of the flask,
that it is composed of a series of loosely-attached longitudinal
threads, converging, like so many bristles, to a
blunt point, in the middle of which is a circular opening<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>.
It is through this opening that the moth escapes. The
silk of its cocoon is of so strong a texture and so closely
gummed, that had both ends been similarly closed, its
egress would have been impracticable; it finds, however,
no difficulty in forcing its way through the aperture of a
sort of reversed funnel, formed of converging threads
that readily yield to pressure from within. But an objection
will here probably strike you. You will ask, Is
not this facility of egress purchased at too dear a rate?
Must not a chrysalis in an open cocoon be exposed to
the attacks of those ichneumons of which you have said
so much, and of numerous other enemies, which will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
admittance through this vaunted door? Our caterpillar
would seem to have foreseen your dilemma; at least, under
heavenly guidance, she has guarded against the danger
as effectually as if she had. If you cut open the cocoon
longitudinally, you will see that within the exterior
funnel-shaped end, at some distance she has framed a
second funnel, composed of a similar circular series of
stiff threads, which, proceeding from the sides of the cocoon,
converge also to a point, and form a sort of cone
exactly like the closed peristome of a moss; or, to use a
more humble though not less apt illustration, like the
wires of certain mousetraps<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>. In this dome not the
slightest opening is left, and from its arched structure it
is impenetrable to the most violent efforts of any marauders
from without; whilst it yields to the slightest
pressure from within, and allows the egress of the moth
with the utmost facility. When she has passed through
it, the elastic threads resume their former position, and
the empty cocoon presents just the same appearance as
one still inhabited. RÃ¶sel relates with amusing naÃ¯vÃ©tÃ©
how this circumstance puzzled him the first time he witnessed
it: he could scarcely help thinking that there was
something supernatural in the appearance of one of these
fine moths in a box in which he had put a cocoon of
this kind, but in which he could not discover the slightest
appearance of any insect having escaped from it, until
he slit it longitudinally<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>. But from an observation of
Meinecken, it appears that these converging threads serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
a double purpose; being necessary to compress the abdomen
of the moth as it emerges from the cocoon, which
forces the fluids to enter the nervures of the wings, and
give them their proper expansion. For he found, that
when the pupa is taken out of the cocoon, the moth is
disclosed at the proper time, but remains always crippled
in its wings; which never expand properly, unless the
abdomen be compressed with the finger and thumb, so
as to imitate the natural operation<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>.</p>

<p>I am next to give you some account of the <i>second</i>
mode in which the release of the perfect insect from
its cocoon is effected&mdash;that, namely, wherein its own
exertions chiefly accomplish the work. I shall from a
large number select only a few instances. The texture
of the cocoon of the silkworm-moth is uniform in every
part, and the layers of silk are equally thick at both
ends. The moth makes its way out by cutting or
breaking these threads at the end opposite to its head:
an operation which, as it destroys the continuity of
the silk, those who breed these insects are particularly
careful to guard against, by exposing the cocoon to
heat sufficient to destroy the included pupa. The question
is&mdash;What instruments does the moth employ to
effect this? And this we are not able to answer satisfactorily.
Malpighi asserts that the animal first wets the
silk with a liquid calculated to dissolve the gum that
connects the threads, and then employs its lengthened
head to push them aside and make an opening<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>. But, as
Reaumur has observed, besides that so obtuse a part as the
head of a moth is but ill fitted to act as a wedge, we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the threads not merely pushed to each side, but actually
cut asunder. He therefore infers that the eyes, which are
the only hard organs of the head, are the instruments by
which the threads are divided&mdash;their numerous minute
facets serving the purpose of a fine file<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>. It should be
observed, however, that Mr. Swayne confirms Malpighi's
assertion, that the silkworm does not cut, but merely
pushes aside, the threads of its cocoon; and he informs
us that he has proved the fact, by unwinding a pierced
cocoon, the thread of which was entire<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>. Yet Reaumur's
correctness cannot be suspected: and he affirms,
that from observation there can scarcely be a doubt that
most of the threads are broken<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>; which is further confirmed
in an account of the breeding of silk-worms published
in the <i>American Philosophical Transactions</i>: in
which it is expressly stated, that cocoons out of which
the fly has escaped, cannot be wound<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>. Analogy, it
must be confessed, is against Reaumur's opinion; since
other kinds of silkworms make their escape by means of
a <i>fluid</i>. Thus we are informed by Dr. Roxburgh, that
<i>Attacus Paphia</i>, when prepared to assume the imago,
discharges from its mouth a large quantity of liquid, with
which the upper end of the case is so perfectly softened,
as to enable the moth to work its way out in a very short
space of time,&mdash;an operation which, he says, is always
performed in the night<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>. Perhaps the two opinions may
be reconciled, by supposing the silkworm first to moisten
and then break the threads of its cocoon. In those
that are of a slighter texture, a mere push against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
moistened end is probably sufficient: and hence we find
in so many newly disclosed moths the hair in that part
wet, and closely pressed down<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>. If it be apparently
difficult for the silkworm-moth to effect an opening in its
cocoon, how much harder must seem the task of the
puss-moth (<i>Cerura Vinula</i>) to pierce the solid walls of its
wood-thickened case? Here the eyes are clearly incompetent;
nor could any ordinary fluid assist their operation,
for the gum which unites the ligneous particles is
indissoluble in <i>aqueous</i> menstrua. You begin to tremble
for the fate of the moth incarcerated in such an impervious
dungeon&mdash;but without cause: what an <i>aqueous</i> solvent
cannot effect, an <i>acid</i> is competent to: and with a
bag of such acid our moth is furnished. The contents of
this she pours out as soon as she has forced her head
through the skin of the chrysalis, and upon the opposite
end of the cocoon. The acid instantly acts upon the
gum, loosens the cohesion of the grains of wood, and a
very gentle effort suffices to push down what was a minute
ago so strong a barrier. How admirable and effectual
a provision! But there is yet another marvel connected
with it. Ask a chemist, of what materials a vessel
ought to be to contain so potent an acid: he will reply,&mdash;of
glass. Yet our moth has no glass recipient: her
bottle is a membranous bag; but of so wonderful a fabric
as not to be acted upon by a menstruum which a gum,
apparently of a resinous nature, is unable to resist! This
fact can only be explained by the analogous insensibility
of the stomach to the gastric juice, which in some
animals can dissolve bone,&mdash;and it is equally worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
admiration. In both cases, the vitality of the membranous
or fleshy receptacle secures it from the action of
the included fluid; but <i>how</i>&mdash;who shall explain?</p>

<p>Ordinarily it is the moth that breaks the cocoon; but
in the goat-moth and many <i>Tortrices</i> it is the pupa itself
that performs the work, either wholly or partially.
The pupa of the former is for this purpose furnished
with sharp points upon the head, capable of effecting
this object<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>. The locust-moth, another species of <i>Cossus</i>
(<i>C. RobiniÃ¦</i> Peck), whose history has been admirably
detailed by Professor Peck, has a different process. "In
the silk-moth," says he, "and all others which I have
had opportunity to observe, the chrysalis bursts <i>in</i> the
cocoon, and the fluid which surrounded the new insect in
it escaping at the same time, so weakens or dissolves the
fibre and texture of the silk, that the moth is able to extricate
itself, leaving the chrysalis behind it; but this is
not the manner in the locust-moth. After remaining till
all its parts are fully grown and it is ready to quit its
prison, a certain quantity of exercise is necessary, to
break the ligaments which attach the moth to the shell
of the chrysalis, and to loosen the folds of the abdomen.
In taking this exercise, it can only move the abdomen in
various directions: as one side of the rings is moved forward,
the hooks in the serrated lines above mentioned
(the <i>adminicula</i>) take hold of the silk, and prevent their
sliding back; the next flexure brings forward the opposite
side of the rings, which are prevented by the points
on that side from slipping back in the same manner, and
the chrysalis is forced out of the slightly woven extremity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
of the cocoon, and through the silk-lined cavity, till it is
protruded for about one-third of its length out of the
opening in the bark, and into the air<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>."</p>

<p>An exception to the general rule&mdash;that the rupturing
of the cocoon is the business of the inclosed insect itself&mdash;is
met with amongst ants; the workers of which not
only feed the young, but actually make an aperture in
their cocoons, cutting the threads with their mandibles
with admirable dexterity and patience, one by one, at
the time they are ready to emerge, the precise period for
which these indefatigable nurses are well aware of, that
they may meet with no obstacle. Without this aid, the
young ant would be unable to force its way through the
strong and dense coating of silk that infolds it<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>. And a
proceeding somewhat akin to this was observed by the
Hon. Captain Percy, R.N., who himself related it to me.
Being fond of the study of insects, he was in the habit of
attending to their motions; and in the beginning of September
1821 noticed those of a number of female <i>TipulÃ¦</i>,
probably <i>T. oleracea</i> L., busily engaged in depositing
their eggs amongst the roots of grass. While observing
these proceedings, he at the same time saw one quitting
its pupa-case, which had already by its own efforts got
its head, thorax, and anterior legs out of it. It was then
joined by two <i>male</i> flies; which, with their anal forceps
and posterior legs taking hold of the pupa-case, appeared
with their mouths and anterior legs to push the little prisoner
upwards, moving her backwards and forwards;
and as they kept raising her, shifting their hold of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
skin till she was entirely extricated, when they left her
to recover her strength by herself. Probably the extreme
length of the two pair of hind-legs of these animals may
render such assistance necessary for their extrication.</p>

<p>There remains yet to be explained under this head the
manner in which the perfect insect is excluded from certain
aquatic pupÃ¦; such as those of <i>PhryganeÃ¦</i>, gnats,
and one of those <i>TipulidÃ¦</i> that resemble gnats. These
pupÃ¦ (perhaps that they may be safe from the attack of
birds) are destined to remain during the greater part of
their existence in this state at the bottom of the water.
But it is obvious that if the perfect insects were there to
be disclosed, their wings would be wetted, and they would
be drowned. It is the provision by which this result is
obviated that now calls for your attention.</p>

<p>You have already been told that the larvÃ¦ of <i>PhryganeÃ¦</i>
inclose themselves in cases of different materials,
open at each end<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>. You have also learned, that in becoming
pupÃ¦, they secure each end of their cases with a
grating of silk<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>. When that change has occurred, they
remain motionless at the bottom of the water. Now how
are these pupÃ¦, encased in tubes of a greater specific
gravity than the surrounding fluid, to make their way to
the surface when the time has arrived for their becoming
denizens of the air? This they accomplish in the following
manner:&mdash;The pupa is furnished with two strong
exterior moveable mandibuliform processes, and has the
power of moving its four anterior legs and antennÃ¦ while
in the pupa-case. With these temporary <i>jaws</i> it makes
an opening in one of the silken doors of its case, forces its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
way out at that end, and then by moving its legs, the
cases of which in some species are ciliated for this very
purpose, swims to the surface, where its skin splits, and
discloses the included insect. That these jaws are given
for the express and exclusive purpose of being thus applied,
seems undeniable. The pupa eats nothing&mdash;they
are therefore in every other point of view superfluous.
They are given to it alone of all other similar pupÃ¦, because
unnecessary to all others; and they are cast off
along with the rest of the puparium, the perfect insect
having no vestige of jaws<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>gnat</i> has to undergo its change on the surface of
the water&mdash;How is it to accomplish this without being
wetted? In the pupa state they usually remain suspended
with the posterior end of the body turned downwards:
but when the period for its change is arrived, it stretches
it out upon the surface, above which its thorax is elevated.
Scarcely has it been a moment in this position, than,
swelling out the interior and anterior parts of the thorax,
it causes it to split between the two respiratory horns.
Through this opening the anterior part of the gnat then
emerges. As soon as the head and trunk are disengaged,
it proceeds with its labour, and gets out more and more;
elevating itself so as to appear in the puparium like a
mast in a boat. As it proceeds, the mast is more and
more elevated and lengthened, till it becomes nearly perpendicular&mdash;just
as the mast of a boat is gradually raised
from a nearly horizontal to a vertical position: at this
period a very small portion of the abdomen remains in
the puparium. Neither its legs nor wings are of any use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
in maintaining it in this position. The latter are too soft,
and, as it were, folded; and the former are stretched out
along the abdomen&mdash;the segments of this last part are the
only agents. The observer who sees how the little boat
gradually sinks, and how its margin approaches the water,
forgets the mischievous insect it contains, which at
another time he would crush without remorse, and becomes
interested for its fate; especially should wind agitate
the water. A very little is sufficient to drive about
rapidly the little voyager, since it catches the wind in
some degree as a sail. If it should be upset, it would be
all over with it;&mdash;and numbers do thus perish. The gnat,
after having fixed itself thus perpendicularly, draws first
its two anterior legs out of their case, and moves them
forward, and next the two intermediate ones; then inclining
itself towards the water, it rests its legs upon it,
for water is to them a soil sufficiently firm and solid to
support them, although surcharged with the weight of
the insect's body. As soon as it is thus upon the water,
it is in safety; its wings unfold themselves and are dried,
and it flies away. All this is the work of an instant<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>.</p>

<p>The pupÃ¦ of <i>Chironomus plumosus</i> proceed from those
red worm-like larvÃ¦ so common throughout the summer
in tubs of rain-water, &amp;c., described by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>.
They are not inclosed in cases, but are of a greater specific
gravity than the water at the bottom of which they
reside, until within a few hours of the exclusion of the
fly. They have the power of swimming, however; and
by moving the tail alternately backwards and forwards,
can slowly raise themselves to the top of the water. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
here occurs a difficulty. For the extrication of the imago
it is necessary that they should remain quietly suspended
at the surface; and moreover that the thorax, in which
the opening for its exit is to be made, should be at least
level with it: and this is precisely what takes place. If
you watch one of these pupÃ¦ when it ascends from the
bottom, you will see that as soon as it has reached the top
it remains suspended there motionless; and that its thorax
is the highest part of the body, and level with the
surface. Now the question is, in what way this is accomplished?
How can a pupa of greater specific gravity than
water, remain suspended without motion at its surface?
and how can its thorax, which is at its heaviest end, be
kept uppermost?&mdash;By a most singular and beautiful contrivance,
which I shall explain; the more particularly
because it has escaped Reaumur, and, as far as I know,
all other entomological observers. The middle of the
back of the thorax has the property of repelling water&mdash;apparently
from being covered with some oily secretion.
Hence, as soon as the pupa has once forced this part of
its body above the surface, the water is seen to retreat
from it on all sides, leaving an oval space in the disk,
which is quite dry. Now though the specific gravity of
the pupa is greater than that of water, it is but so very
slightly greater, that the mere attraction of the air to the
dry part of the thorax, when once exposed to it, is sufficient
to retain it at the surface; just as a small dry needle
swims under similar circumstances. That this is a true
solution of the phÃ¦nomenon, I am convinced by the result
of several experiments. If, when the pupa is suspended
at the surface, a drop of water be let fall upon
the dry portion of the thorax, it instantly sinks to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
bottom,&mdash;the thorax, which belongs to the heaviest half,
being the lowest; and if the pupa be again brought to the
surface, so that the fluid is repelled from its disk, it remains
suspended there without effort, as before. Just
previously to the exclusion of the fly, the dry part of the
thorax is seen to split in the middle. The air enters, and
forms a brilliant stratum resembling quicksilver, between
the body of the insect and its puparium; and the former
pushing forth its head and forelegs, like the gnat, rests
the latter upon the water, and in a few seconds extricates
itself wholly from its envelope.</p>

<p>Before I close this letter, I must state a fact connected
with the subject of it that deserves to be recorded. It is
a general rule, that <i>one</i> pupa-case incloses only <i>one</i> insect;
but Kleesius, a German entomologist, asserts that he
had once <i>two</i> specimens of <i>Gastropacha quercifolia</i> produced
from <i>one</i> pupa; which was large, being full two
inches long, and one thick.</p>

<h3><i>STATES OF INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>IMAGO STATE.</h5>


<p>When the insect has quitted the exuviÃ¦ of the pupa, it
has attained the last stage of its existence. It is now
termed an <i>Imago</i>, or perfect insect; and is capable of
propagation.</p>

<p>Just after its exclusion, it is weak, soft, and languid:
all its parts are covered with moisture; and, if a winged
insect, its wings have so little the appearance, either in
shape, size, or colour, which they are about to assume,
that it might be taken for a mutilated abortion, rather
than an animal in the most vigorous stage of life. If it
be a beetle, its elytra, instead of covering the back of the
abdomen, are folded over the breast: their substance is
soft and leathery, and their white colour exhibits no
traces of the several tints which are to adorn them. If
the insect be a butterfly or a moth, the wings, instead
of being of their subsequent amplitude, and variegated
and painted with a variety of hues and markings, are in
large species scarcely bigger than the little finger nail,
falling over the sides of the trunk, and of a dull muddy
colour, in which no distinct characters can be traced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
If the excluded insect be a bee or a fly, its whole skin is
white and looks fleshy, and quite unlike the coloured
hairy crust which it will turn to in an hour or two; and
the wings, instead of being a thin, transparent, expanded
film, are contracted into a thick, opaque, wrinkled
mass.</p>

<p>These symptoms of debility and imperfection, however,
in most cases speedily vanish. The insect, fixing
itself on the spoils of the pupa, or some other convenient
neighbouring support, first stretches out one organ, and
then another: the moisture of its skin evaporates, the
texture becomes firm, the colours come forth in all their
beauty; the hairs and scales assume their natural position;
and the wings expanding, extend often to five or
six times their former size&mdash;exhibiting, as if by magic,
either the thin transparent membranes of the bee or fly,
or the painted and scaly films of the butterfly or moth,
or the coloured shells of the beetle. The proceedings
here described I witnessed very recently with regard to
a very interesting and beautiful butterfly, the only one of
its description that Britain has yet been ascertained to
produce&mdash;I mean <i>Papilio Machaon</i>. The pupa of this
being brought to me by a friend early in May this year
(1822), on the sixteenth of that month I had the pleasure
to see it leave its puparium. With great care I placed it
upon my arm, where it kept pacing about for the space of
more than an hour; when all its parts appearing consolidated
and developed, and the animal perfect in beauty,
I secured it, though not without great reluctance, for my
cabinet&mdash;it being the only living specimen of this fine fly
I had ever seen. To observe how gradual, and yet how
rapid, was the development of the parts and organs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
particularly of the wings, and the perfect coming forth of
the colours and spots, as the sun gave vigour to it, was a
most interesting spectacle. At first it was unable to elevate
or even move its wings; but in proportion as the
aÃ«rial or other fluid was forced by the motions of its trunk
into their nervures, their numerous corrugations and folds
gradually yielded to the action, till they had gained their
greatest extent, and the film between all the nervures became
tense. The ocelli, and spots and bars, which appeared
at first as but germes or rudiments of what they
were to be, grew with the growing wing, and shone forth
upon its complete expansion in full magnitude and
beauty.</p>

<p>To understand more clearly the cause of this rapid
expansion and development of the wings, I have before
explained to you that these organs, though often exceedingly
thin, are always composed of two membranes, having
most commonly a number of hollow vessels, miscalled
nerves, running between them<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>. These tubes, which,
after the French Entomologists, I would name <i>nervures</i>,
contribute as well to the development of the wings, as to
their subsequent tension. In the pupa, and commonly
afterwards, the two membranes composing the organs in
question do not touch each other's inner surface, as they
afterwards do: there is consequently a space between
them; and being moist, and corrugated into a vast number
of folds like those of a fan, but transverse as well as
longitudinal, and so minute as to be imperceptible to the
naked eye, the wings appear much thicker than in the
end. Now as soon as the insect is disclosed, a fluid enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the tubes, and being impelled into their minutest ramifications,
necessarily expands their folds; for the nervures
themselves are folded, and as they gradually extend in
length with them, the moist membranes attached to them
are also unfolded and extended. In proportion as this
takes place, the expanding membranes approach each
other, and at last, being dried by the action of the atmosphere,
become one. To promote this motion of the fluid,
seems the object of the agitations which the animal from
time to time gives to its unexpanded wings. That a kind
of circulation, or rather an injection of an aqueous fluid
into these organs, actually takes place, may be ascertained
by a very simple experiment. If you clip the wings of a
butterfly during the process of expansion, you will see
that the nervures are not only hollow, but that, however
dry and empty they may subsequently be found, they at
that time actually contain such a fluid<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>. Swammerdam,
who appears to have been the first physiologist that paid
attention to this subject, was of opinion that an aÃ«riform
as well as an aquiform fluid contributes to produce the
effect we are considering. He had observed that, if a
small portion be cut off from the wing of a bee, a fluid of
the latter kind exuded from its vessels in the form of
pellucid globules, becoming insensibly drops&mdash;which he
concluded proved the action of the latter; and he noticed,
also, that the wings were furnished with tracheÃ¦,
which were at that time distended by the injected air;
whence he justly surmised, that the action of the <i>air</i> was
also of great importance to produce the expansion of the
wing<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>. And Jurine found that every nervure contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
a trachea, which, proceeding from the interior of the
trunk in a serpentine direction, follows all the ramification
of the nervure, though it does not fill it<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>. Though
Reaumur attributes the expansion of the wings chiefly to
an <i>aqueous</i> fluid, yet he suspects that the <i>air</i> on some
occasions contributed to it<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>.</p>

<p>The wings of the other tribes of insects probably differ
from the <i>Lepidoptera</i> in the manner in which they are
folded. It should seem from Reaumur's description, that
those of some flies, instead of the straight transverse folds
of the former, have angular or zigzag folds<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>; which
equally shorten the wing. Many <i>Hymenoptera</i> have
wings without any nervures except the marginal. We
may conjecture that these are more simply folded, so as
to render their expansion more easy; but even in these
wings there are often tracheÃ¦, which appear as spurious
nervures, and help to effect the purpose we are considering.</p>

<p>The operation of expanding their wings, in by far the
larger number of insects, takes place gradually as described
above; and, according to their size, is ended in
five, ten, or fifteen minutes; in some butterflies half an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
hour, in some even an hour. A few species, such as
<i>Sphinx &#338;notherÃ¦</i> F., require several hours, or even a
day, for this operation; and, from the distance to which
they creep before it has taken place, a considerable degree
of motion seems requisite for causing the necessary
impulse of the expanding fluids<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>. In a few genera, however,
as the gnat, the gnat-like TipulidÃ¦, and the EphemerÃ¦,
this process is so rapid and instantaneous, that the
wings are scarcely disengaged from the wing-cases before
they are fully expanded and fit for flying. These genera
quit the pupa at the surface of the water, from which,
after resting upon it for a few moments, they take flight:
but this would evidently be impracticable, and immersion
in the fluid, and consequent death, would result, were not
the general rule in their case deviated from.</p>

<p>Some species of the last of these genera, <i>Ephemera</i>,
are distinguished by another peculiarity, unparalleled, as
far as is known, in the rest of the insect world. After being
released from the puparium, and making use of their
expanded wings for flight, often to a considerable distance,
they have yet to undergo another metamorphosis.
They fix themselves by their claws in a vertical position
upon some object, and withdraw every part of the body,
even the legs and wings, from a thin pellicle which has
inclosed them, as a glove does the fingers; and so exactly
do the exuviÃ¦, which remain attached to the spot where
the Ephemera disrobed itself, retain their former figure,
that I have more than once at first sight mistaken them
for the perfect insect. You can conceive without difficulty
how the body, and even legs, can be withdrawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
from their cases; but you must be puzzled to conjecture
how the wings, which seem as thin, as much expanded,
and as rigid as those of a fly, can admit of having any
sheath stripped from them; much less how they can be
withdrawn, as they are, through a small opening at the
base of the sheath. The fact seems to be, that though
the outer covering is rigid, the wing inclosed in it, notwithstanding
it is sometimes more than twenty-four hours
before the change ensues, is kept moist and pliable. In
proportion, therefore, as the insect disengages itself from
the anterior part of the skin, the interior or real wings
become contracted by a number of plaits into a form
nearly cylindrical, which readily admits of their being
pulled through the opening lately mentioned; and as
soon as the insect is released from its envelope, the plaits
unfold, and the wing returns to its former shape and dimensions.
Thus our little animal, having bid adieu to
its shirt and drawers, becomes, but in a very harmless
sense, a genuine <i>descamisado</i> and <i>sansculotte</i>. It does
not seem improbable, that the pellicle we have been
speaking of is analogous to that which, in addition to the
outer skin, incloses the limbs of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, &amp;c. in the
pupa state, but which they cast at the same time with the
puparium, and leave adhering to it<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>.</p>

<p>The body of newly-disclosed insects commonly appears
at first of its full size; but the aphidivorous flies
(<i>Syrphus</i> F. &amp;c.), and some others, in about a quarter of
an hour after leaving the pupa become at least twice as
large as they were at their first appearance: this apparent
sudden growth, which is also noticed by Goedart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Reaumur found to depend upon the expansion of the
previously compressed segments of the animal by means
of the included air<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>. Both in this instance and in that
of insects whose wings only require expansion, the size
of the <i>imago</i> often so greatly exceeds that of the <i>pupa</i>,
that we can scarcely believe our eyes that it should have
been included in so contracted a space. The pupa of
one of the beautiful lace-winged flies (<i>Hemerobius Perla</i>)
is not so big as a small pea, yet the body of the fly is
nearly half an inch long, and covers, when its wings and
antennÃ¦ are expanded, a surface of an inch square<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>.</p>

<p>When the development of the perfect insect is complete,
and all its parts and organs have attained the requisite
firmness and solidity<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>, it immediately begins to
exercise them in their intended functions; it walks,
runs, or flies in search of food; or of the other sex of its
own species, if it be a male, that it may fulfill the great
end of its existence in this state&mdash;the propagation of its
kind. Previously to thus launching into the wide world,
or at least immediately afterwards, almost all insects discharge
from their intestines some drops of an excrementitious
fluid, often transparent, and sometimes red. I
have before related to you the alarm that this last circumstance
has now and then produced on the minds of
the ignorant and superstitious<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>. Whether this excrement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
is produced indifferently both by males and females
I cannot positively assert; but a circumstance related
by Jurine affords some ground for a suspicion that it
is peculiar to the latter. A specimen of a female of
<i>Lasiocampa Rubi</i>, when killed emitted some of this
fluid, which dropped upon the floor: this appeared to
attract the males to the apartment in which it happened,
and to the very spot&mdash;from whence it may be conjectured,
that the scent of the fluid brought them there, and that
the use of it is to bring the sexes together soon after exclusion
from the pupa<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>.</p>

<p>The colour, sculpture, and other peculiarities which
distinguish insects in this state I shall consider at large
in another letter, when I treat of their external parts and
organs. Under the present head I shall confine myself
to pointing out the characters by which the <i>sexes</i> of many
species are distinguished from each other; as likewise
the <i>duration of their life</i> in their perfect state; together
with the circumstances on which this duration depends.</p>


<p>I. <i>Sexual Distinctions.</i> The first general rule that
may be laid down under this section is,&mdash;That among
insects, contrary to what mostly occurs in vertebrate
animals, the <i>size</i> of the female is almost constantly larger
than that of the male. Even in the larva and pupa states,
a practised eye can judge, from their greater size, which
individuals will become females. There are, however,
some exceptions to this rule. Thus amongst the <i>Coleoptera</i>,
the male <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>, remarkable for their horns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
as you may see in <i>D. Alocus</i>, <i>AntÃ¦us</i>, <i>ActÃ¦on</i>, &amp;c., as
likewise those of <i>Lucanus</i>, are larger than the unarmed
females<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>. In the <i>Neuroptera</i> the female <i>LibellulidÃ¦</i> are
sometimes sensibly smaller, and never larger, than their
males<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> the male of the hive-bee,
but more particularly that of <i>Anthidium manicatum</i> and
other bees of that genus, is much more robust than the
other sex<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>. In the <i>Diptera</i>, the same difference is observable
in <i>Syrphus Ribesii</i>, and some other aphidivorous
flies, and also in <i>Scatophaga stercoraria</i><a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>. And amongst
the <i>apterous</i> tribes, we are informed by De Geer that
the male of <i>Argyroneta aquatica</i>, which builds an aÃ«rial
palace in the bosom of the waters<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>, usually exceeds the
female in bulk<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>. The reason of this rule seems in some
degree connected with the office of the female as a mother,
that sufficient space may be allowed for the vast
number of eggs she is destined to produce; and it is
when impregnation has taken place, and the eggs are
ready for extrusion, that the difference is most sensible.
In the majority of cases this sexual disproportion is not
very considerable, but in some few it is enormous. Reaumur
mentions a beetle, of which he intended to give the
history, the male of which is so small compared with the
female, that a bull not bigger than a sheep, or even a
hare, set by the side of the largest cow, would aptly contrast
with them. This little beetle, he says, has wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and elytra, while the giant female has no vestige of either,
having the upper surface of its body naked and membranous<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>.
The species to which this illustrious Naturalist
here alludes, does not appear to have been ascertained.
The female of many gall-insects (<i>Cocci</i>) is so large in
comparison with the male, that the latter traverses her
back as an ample area for a walk<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>. But this is nothing
compared with the prodigious difference between the
sexes of <i>Termes fatale</i>, and other species of white ants,
whose males are often many thousand times less than the
females, when the latter are distended with eggs<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>. Accidental
differences in the size of the sexes sometimes arise:
as when the female larva has, from any cause, been deprived
of its proper supply of food, it will occasionally be
less than the male. De Geer has stated a circumstance
with respect to the <i>Aphides</i> that produce galls, that
should be mentioned under this head&mdash;the first, or <i>mother</i>
female, is larger than any of her progeny ever become<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>.</p>

<p>The second observation that may be generally applied
to the sexes of insects is, that, size excepted, there is a
close resemblance between them in other respects. But
to this rule the exceptions are very numerous, and so important
that it is necessary to specify examples of each
under distinct heads.</p>


<p>i. In some species the sexes are either partly or wholly
of a different <i>colour</i>. Thus, in the order <i>Coleoptera</i>, the
elytra of the male of <i>Rhagium meridianum</i> F. are testaceous,
and those of the female black. <i>Leptura rubra</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
LinnÃ©, with red elytra, is the female of his <i>L. testacea</i>,
in which they are testaceous. <i>Cantharis dermestoides</i> of
the same author is the other sex of his <i>Meloe Marci</i>;
one of which is chiefly testaceous, and the other black:
which seems to have so misled LinnÃ©, that he placed
them in different genera. One more instance in this
order, the female of <i>Cicindela campestris</i>, as was first observed
to me by our friend Sheppard, has a black dot on
each elytrum, not far from its base near the suture, which
the male has not.</p>

<p>Amongst the <i>Orthoptera</i>, the male <i>LocustÃ¦</i> F., as Professor
Lichtenstein has informed us<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>, have a fenestrated
ocellus, which is not to be found in the other sex. I was
once attending to the proceedings of a Hemipterous species,
<i>Pentatoma oleracea</i> Latr., which I found in union:
the paired insects had white spots, but another individual
was standing by them, in which the spots were of a sanguine
hue. I mention this by the way only&mdash;the spots
in the prolific sexes being of the same colour: but might
not the red spotted one be a neuter?</p>

<p>The sexes of many <i>Lepidoptera</i> likewise differ in their
colour. I must single out a few from a great number of
instances. The males of <i>LycÃ¦na Argus</i> F. have the upper
surface of their anterior wings of a dark blue, while
in the female it is wholly brown. The wings of the former
sex of <i>Hypogymna dispar</i> are gray, clouded with
brown; but those of the latter are white, with black
spots. In the brimstone butterfly (<i>Colias Rhamni</i>), which
is one of the first that appear in the spring, the wings of
the male are yellow&mdash;of the female whitish. In the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
orange-tip (<i>Pieris Cardamines</i> F.), one sex has not
the orange tip to the upper wings: and, to name no more,
the male of <i>LycÃ¦na dispar</i>, one of our rarest and most
beautiful butterflies, has only a single black spot in the
disk of its fulgid wings; while in the other sex, the primary
pair have nine, and the secondary are black, with
a transverse orange fascia near the posterior margin.
But the most remarkable difference in this respect observable
in the insects of the order in question, takes
place in a tribe, of which only one species is certainly
known to inhabit Britain&mdash;I mean the <i>Papiliones Equites</i>
of LinnÃ©: what he has called his <i>Trojani</i> and <i>Achivi</i> in
some instances have proved only different sexes of the
same species. Mr. MacLeay's rich cabinet affords a singular
instance confirming this assertion;&mdash;a specimen of
a Papilio is divided longitudinally, the right hand side
being male, and the left hand female. The former belongs
to <i>P. Polycaon</i>, a Grecian, the latter to <i>P. Laodocus</i>,
a Trojan. An instance of two <i>Grecians</i> thus united
is recorded in the <i>EncyclopÃ©die MÃ©thodique</i>, as exhibited
in a specimen preserved in the Museum of Natural History
at Paris; which on the right hand side is <i>P. Ulysses</i>,
on the left <i>P. Diomedes</i><a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Neuroptera</i>, the <i>LibellulidÃ¦</i> are remarkable for
the differences of colour in the sexes. In the common
<i>Libellula depressa</i>, which you may see hawking over
every pool, the abdomen of the male is usually slate-colour,
while that of his partner is yellow, but with darker
side-spots. Reaumur, however, noticed some males that
were of the same colour with the females<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>. Schelver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
observed, when he put the skins of <i>Libellula depressa</i> into
water, that the colours common to both sexes were in
the substance of the skin, and remained fixed; while
those that were peculiar to one could be taken off with a
hair-pencil, and coloured the water: which therefore
were superficial, and, as it were, laid on<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>. The yellow
males, therefore, that Reaumur observed, were probably
such as had the superficial blue colour which distinguishes
them washed off. In <i>Calepteryx Virgo</i> Leach, the former
are of a lovely silky blue, and the latter green. In
<i>Agrions</i> F. nature sports infinitely in the colours of the
sexes.</p>

<p>In the order <i>Hymenoptera</i> there are often differences
equally great; the sexes of many of the Ichneumons and
Saw-flies are of quite different colours. The former tribe
LinnÃ© has divided into sections, from the white annulus
observable in the antennÃ¦ of some, and from the colour
of their scutellum: but these are often merely sexual
characters<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>. The male of <i>Anthophora retusa</i> Latr., a
kind of wild bee, is wholly black, the female wholly gray,
and of so very different an aspect that they were long
regarded as distinct species; a mistake which has likewise
occurred with regard to the sexes of <i>Osmia cÃ¦rulescens</i>,
another bee, of which the male has a bronzed and the
female a violet abdomen<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>. The nose of male <i>AndrenÃ¦</i>
Latr. is often yellow, or white, as in <i>A. hÃ¦morrhoidalis</i>&mdash;when
that of the female is black<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>. The <i>labrum</i> also is often
of a different colour in the sexes, as in <i>Ceratina</i> Latr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Diptera</i>, <i>Aptera</i>, <i>Arachnida</i>, &amp;c., I am not aware
of any striking difference in the colours of the sexes.</p>


<p>ii. The sexes of insects vary (but more rarely than in
colour) in their <i>sculpture</i> also, and <i>pubescence</i>. Thus the
elytra of the females of many of the larger water-beetles
(<i>Dytiscus</i>) are deeply furrowed, while those of the males
are quite smooth and level<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>. The thorax of the female
in several species of <i>Colymbetes</i> of the same tribe, as
<i>C. Hybneri</i> and <i>transversalis</i>, on each side has several
tortuous impressed lines or scratches, like net-work,
which are not to be discovered in the male. <i>Hyphydrus
gibbus</i> Latr., which differs solely from <i>H. ovalis</i> (<i>Dytiscus
ovalis</i> Illig.) in being thickly covered with minute
impressed puncta, is, from the observation of the Rev.
R. Sheppard, the other sex of this last, with which he
has taken it coupled; and it is by no means improbable
that <i>Hydroporus picipes</i> (<i>Dytiscus punctatus</i> Marsh.) and
<i>H. lineatus</i>,&mdash;between which, as Gyllenhal has justly observed,
the same difference only exists,&mdash;are in like manner
sexual varieties. With respect to <i>pubescence</i>, I have
not much to say. Another aquatic beetle, <i>Acilius sulcatus</i>
Leach, has not only its elytra sulcated, but the furrows
of these, and a transverse one of the thorax, are thickly
set with hair; while the male is smooth, and quite naked.
Particular care seems to have been taken by the Creator,
that when all the above inhabitants of the water are paired,
the male should be able to fix himself so firmly, by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
of his remarkable anterior tarsi, (which I shall afterwards
describe,) and these asperities, &amp;c. in the upper surface
of his mate, as not to be displaced by the fluctuations of
that element, the reluctance of the coy female, or any
other slighter cause.</p>

<p>In a moth called the ghost (<i>Hepialus Humuli</i>), the
posterior tibia of the male is densely bearded, but not of
the female<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>.&mdash;Some <i>Hymenoptera</i>, as <i>Ammophila</i> Kirb.
and <i>Stigmus</i> Jurine, have the upper lip of the male clothed
with silver pile, while that of the female is not so ornamented.
The legs of some bees are distinguished in the
sexes by a difference in their <i>clothing</i>. That observable
in those of the hive-bee has been before noticed<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>. In
<i>Andrena</i> of Latreille<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> the posterior tibia of the female is
covered externally with a dense brush of hairs, for collecting
the pollen; and the posterior legs at their base
have a curled lock of hair&mdash;which are not to be found in
the male<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>. In <i>Dasypoda</i>, <i>Melecta</i>, <i>Anthophora</i>, <i>Centris</i>,
<i>Epicharis</i>, &amp;c. of the same author, the first joint of the
tarsus of the female, and in <i>Xylocopa</i> almost the whole
tarsus, is also similarly signalized from that of the other
sex. In <i>Bombus</i>, as in the hive-bee, the posterior tibiÃ¦
of the females and neuters are furnished with a basket of
hairs for carrying their pollen paste, which you will in
vain look for in the male<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>. The latter, however, in some
species of this tribe are distinguished from the former by
the longer hairs of their legs, but not in the posterior
ones. Thus, in <i>Anthophora retusa</i> the first joints of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
intermediate tarsus are bearded internally with a thin
fringe of long hairs, and the first externally with a triangular
one of short ones at the apex: but what is most
remarkable, the last or unguicular joint, which in almost
every other bee is naked, is on both sides fringed
with long hairs<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>. In that remarkable genus <i>Acanthopus</i>
Illig., of which the male only is known, the first and last
joint of the intermediate tarsus have a dense external
brush of stiff hairs, which probably is also a sexual character<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>.
Another sexual kind of clothing is exhibited
by the females of those bees that have their labrum or
upper-lip inflexed (<i>Megachile</i> Latr.)<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>. Their abdomen
is covered underneath with a brush of stiff hairs, involved
in which they carry the pollen they collect. In the males
of some of this tribe, as of <i>M. Willughbiella</i>, the first four
joints of the anterior tarsus on their inner side have a
long dense fringe of incurved hairs<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>: a circumstance
also to be found in the same sex of <i>Xylocopa latipes</i>, in
which the claw-joint also is bearded<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>. In <i>Andrena</i> Latr.
the last dorsal segment of the abdomen of the same sex is
fringed, while that of the male is naked<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>. In the humble-bees
(<i>Bombus</i>), the mandibles of the male are bearded
with curled hairs, while those of the females and neuters
are without them. Some bees, as <i>Andrena</i> and <i>Halictus</i>
Latr., have the anus of the female bearded, and that of the
male naked: in some <i>Bombyces</i> the reverse takes place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>iii. With regard to the general <i>shape</i> of their body,
the male and female usually resemble each other: but
there are some exceptions to this rule. The male of the
hive-bee is much thicker and more clumsy than either
the female or the worker; but in <i>Halictus</i> Latr. the males
are nearly cylindrical in shape, and very narrow; while
the other sex are oblong or ovate, especially their abdomen:
and in <i>Andrena</i> Latr. the former are much slenderer
than the females, and of a more lanceolate shape.
But a still more striking difference in this respect between
the sexes is exhibited by some species of the genus
<i>Ptinus</i> F., in which the male is long and slender, and the
female short and thick. This, in more than one instance,
has occasioned them to be mistaken for distinct insects:
thus, <i>P. Lichenum</i> and <i>P. similis</i>, <i>P. ovatus</i> and <i>P. testaceus</i>,
of Mr. Marsham, are mere sexual varieties. But
the most entire abalienation of shape at present known,
is that which distinguishes the male from the female
<i>Coccus</i>; these are so completely dissimilar as scarcely to
have any part in common. In <i>Bombyx vestita</i> F., and
others of the same family, while the males are of the ordinary
conformation of the order, the females are without
even the slightest rudiments of wings; they have no antennÃ¦,
the legs are extremely short, not longer than
those of the caterpillar; and the body is entirely destitute
of scales, so that they altogether assume the exact
appearance of hexapod larvÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>. A conformation nearly
similar takes place in the female of <i>Tinea Lichenella</i>; but
in this the feet are longer, and the anus is furnished with
a long retractile ovipositor<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>iv. In many cases, the structure of particular <i>parts</i> and
<i>organs</i> of the body differs in the sexes. As the facts connected
with this part of our present subject are extremely
numerous and various, it will be convenient to subdivide
it, and consider the sexual characters that distinguish&mdash;the
<i>Head</i>, <i>Trunk</i>, and <i>Abdomen</i> of insects, and their several
appendages.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Head</i>. This part in some females is considerably
larger than it is in the male. This is the case with
the ants, and several other <i>Hymenoptera</i>; while in some
<i>AndrenÃ¦</i>, as <i>A. hÃ¦morrhoidalis</i>, and <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, as
<i>St. olens</i>, that of the male is the largest. But in none is
the difference more conspicuous than in the stag-beetle
(<i>Lucanus</i>); in which genus the male not only exceeds the
female in the length of his mandibles, but also greatly
in the size and dimensions of his head. In the <i>Apion</i>
genus, the rostrum of the female is generally longer and
slenderer than that of her mate; and in <i>Brentus</i>, the
rostrum of one sex (probably the male) is long and filiform,
while in the other it is thick and short. This is
particularly visible in <i>B. dispar</i> and <i>maxillosus</i><a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One of the most striking distinctions of the males in
this part of their body, are those threatening horns, usually
hollow, with which the heads of many of the male
lamellicorn insects and some others are armed, and which
give them some resemblance to many of the larger quadrupeds.
Many are <i>unicorns</i>, and have their head armed
with only a <i>single</i> horn; which in some, as in <i>Oryctes</i>
Illig., <i>Dynastes Endymion</i><a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>, &amp;c. is very short; in others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
very long, as in <i>Dynastes Enema</i>, <i>Pan</i>, <i>Elephas</i><a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>. In
one, again, it is thick and robust; as in the clumsy <i>Dynastes
ActÃ¦on</i><a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>: in another very slender, as in <i>Onthophagus
spinifer</i><a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>. With respect to its direction in <i>Elephastomus
proboscideus</i> MacLeay, it is horizontal<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> and
straight; in <i>Phaleria cornuta</i> horizontal and broken, or
the apex turning outwards and forming an angle with the
base<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>; in <i>Dynastes Hercules</i> horizontal, and recurved
at the apex<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>; in <i>D. ActÃ¦on</i>, <i>Elephas</i>, and <i>Typhon</i>, recurving
from the base. In <i>Geotrupes dispar</i> it is recurved,
so that its point exactly coincides with that of
the porrected thoracic horn, with which it forms a kind of
forceps<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>. In <i>Copris lunaris</i> F. and <i>Diaperis horrida</i>, the
horn is nearly upright<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>. In <i>Onthophagus Xiphias</i> it is dilated
at the base, and reclining upon the thorax; and at
the apex attenuated, and bending forwards, or nodding.
In <i>Passalus cornutus</i> it rises a little, and then bends wholly
forwards. In <i>Dynastes Milon</i>, a most remarkable beetle,
it slopes backwards in a waving line<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>; and in <i>Onthophagus
spinifer</i> it is recurved and reclining.&mdash;In speaking of the
direction of the horn, you must recollect that it will vary
in proportion as the head varies from a horizontal position:
so that an upright horn will become inclined or
reclined, as the head bends forwards or backwards; but
I speak of it as it appears when the head is horizontal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
Again, it varies in its teeth or branches. In <i>Dynastes
Hercules</i> it is armed with several teeth. In <i>D. Elephas</i>
and <i>ActÃ¦on</i> it has only one large one at its upper base<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>.
In <i>D. Milon</i> it is serrated above. In <i>D. Alcides</i>, <i>Tityus</i>,
<i>Ãgeon</i>, <i>Copris lunaris</i>, &amp;c. the horn is unarmed and simple
at the apex. In <i>D. Oromedon</i>, <i>Gedeon</i>, <i>Enema</i>,
<i>ActÃ¦on</i> and congeners, it is bifid. In some the horn is
at first a broad lamina or ridge, which terminates in two
branches, as in <i>Onthophagus Vacca</i>. In this the branches
are straight; but in another undescribed species in my
cabinet (<i>O. Aries</i> Kirby, MS.) they are first bent inwards,
and then at the apex a little recurved: and in
<i>D. dichotomus</i> it is divided into two short branches, each
of which is bifid<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>. Other males emulate the bull, the
he-goat, or the stag, in having a <i>pair</i> of horns on their
head. In <i>Onthophagus Taurus</i>, these arms in their curvature
exactly resemble those of the first of these animals<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>.
In <i>Goliathus pulverulentus</i>, the straight, robust, diverging,
sharp horns are not unlike those of some of the goat or
gazel tribe. I have a beautiful little specimen in my cabinet,
(I believe collected by Mr. Abbott of Georgia,) in
which the horns have a lateral tooth, or short branch,
like those of a stag; and which I have therefore named
<i>O. cervicornis</i>. In <i>O. Vacca</i>, <i>Camelus</i>, &amp;c. the horns are
very short, and nearly perpendicular. In the male of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
<i>Copris Midas</i>, the two longer perpendicular horns have a
deep cavity between them, which, together with its black
colour, give it a most demoniac aspect; so that you would
think it more aptly representative of a Beelzebub or <i>Beelzebul</i>
than a Midas<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>, or than <i>PhanÃ¦us Beelzebul</i> MacL.
A similar cavity is between the occipital horns of <i>Diaperis
hÃ¦morrhoidalis</i> Payk. Some species of <i>RynchÃ¦nus</i>,
as <i>R. Taurus</i>, have a pair of long horns upon the rostrum
of the male, the rudiments only of which are to be traced
in the female<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>. Other species go beyond any known
quadrupeds in the number of horns that arm their heads.
Thus <i>Ditomus calydonius</i> Bonelli, belonging to <i>Carabus</i> L.,
has <i>three</i> equal horns<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>. The same number distinguishes
<i>Onthophagus Bonasus</i>; but the intermediate one is very
short. In <i>Goliathus Polyphemus</i> the middle horn, on the
contrary, is much longer and thicker than the lateral
ones, and forked at the apex; so that it looks as if it had
four of these weapons<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>. A little <i>Diaperis</i> (<i>D. viridipennis</i>
F.), a native of <i>Carolina</i>, has four horns upon the
head of the male; namely, two long ones on the occiput,
and two short dentiform ones on the nose. In a species
nearly related to this, sent me by Professor Peck from
New England, there is a cavity between the two occipital
horns. The same number distinguishes <i>Onthophagus
quadricornis</i> (<i>Copris</i> F.). The <i>situation</i> also of the
horns varies: In some it is in the <i>middle</i> of the head,
as <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i>, <i>Copris lunaris</i>, &amp;c.: in others, as
in <i>Onthophagus nuchicornis</i>, <i>Xiphias</i>, &amp;c. it is a process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
of the <i>occiput</i> or hind-head; and in <i>O. Oryx</i> F. the two
horns proceed from the <i>anterior</i> part of the head. In
the other sex, in insects the head of whose males is armed
with horns, they are usually replaced by mere tubercles,
or very short elevations, as you may see in the female of
<i>Copris lunaris</i>; or by transverse ridges, as in the <i>Onthophagi</i>:
or else the head is without arms, and quite smooth,
as in <i>Diaperis</i>, <i>Phaleria</i>, &amp;c. What may be the use of
these extraordinary appendages, as well as those on the
thorax, and in some cases on the abdomen, (which I shall
mention afterwards), to the males, has not yet been ascertained.
Whether the individuals of this sex are more
exposed to the attack of birds and other enemies, in consequence
of being more on the wing than the females,
and are therefore thus provided with numerous projecting
points for defence, is a question worth considering<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>.
It is the only probable conjecture on the <i>cui bono</i> of these
arms that I can at present make. Under this head I
ought to notice the remarkable membranous process of
an obovate shape, which like an umbrella covers the
head of <i>Acheta umbraculata</i> F.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> Whether the sharp
curved horns which arm this part in another <i>Acheta</i>
figured by Stoll<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>, in an incumbent posture, with their
point towards the mouth, are a sexual distinction, we are
not informed,&mdash;probably they are.</p>

<p>The <i>organs</i> of the head also present many sexual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
distinctions. The upper lip (<i>labrum</i>) in <i>Halictus</i> Latr., a
tribe of wild bees, in the female is furnished with an inflexed
appendage, which is not discoverable in that of
the male<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>; and the shape of this lip in <i>Sphecodes</i> Latr.
differs in the sexes<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>. Perhaps the horn or tubercle observable
on this part of some female <i>NomadÃ¦</i> F.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> may
be wanting in the male.</p>

<p>The under-lip (<i>labium</i>)&mdash;taken in a restricted sense for
that central part from which emerge the labial palpi, and
which is often considered as the mentum,&mdash;does not offer
any striking variations in the sexes. One, however, is
of importance, as it helps to prove which are the true
female <i>Lucani</i>. In the male the labium is emarginate,
in the female it is intire. This may be seen both in
<i>L. Cervus</i> and <i>femoratus</i>, and probably in other species.
The sculpture also is different, the lip being smooth in
the former and covered with excavated <i>puncta</i> in the latter.
The tongue (<i>lingua</i> or <i>ligula</i>) of the sexes is usually
the same; except in the hive-bee, in which that of the
neuters is longer than that of the male and female.</p>

<p>The upper-jaws (<i>mandibulÃ¦</i>), however, often afford
striking sexual characters. The enormous protended
ones of the common stag-beetle (<i>Lucanus Cervus</i>) attract
the attention of the most incurious observer; and these
are now generally allowed to be of this description.
Geoffroy and Mr. Marsham, indeed, have asserted that
they have taken <i>in coitu</i> those with long mandibles: but
as these males are pugnacious, and attack each other with
great fury, as Mr. Sheppard informs me, it is not improbable
that these gentlemen may have mistaken a <i>battle</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
for an <i>amour</i>: since not only have those with long mandibles
been often taken united with those that have short
ones<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>, but the same difference obtains in the sexes of
other species. This is particularly observable in <i>Lucanus
femoratus</i>, of which I received from Brazil many specimens
agreeing in every respect except in this, that one
had short and the other very long mandibles. These
organs vary in different specimens, as to the number of
their teeth and branches. They are singularly robust in
<i>L. Alces</i><a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>; but in none more threatening than in <i>L. Elephas</i><a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>,
in which they curve outwards and downwards.
In Mr. W. MacLeay's genus <i>Pholidotus</i>, they are almost
parallel to each other, and curve downwards; in <i>Lucanus
nebulosus</i> Kirby, they assume a contrary direction<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>; as they
do likewise in <i>Lamprima</i> Latr.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> In <i>Lucanus Capreolus</i>
the points close over each other<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>. In <i>Lethrus</i> F. in the
female, but not the male, the mandible is armed below with
a long incurved horn. In <i>Lucanus serricornis</i> they form
a complete forceps<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>. In <i>Siagonium quadricorne</i> Kirby<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
the mandible is furnished at its base with an exterior
horn, which is probably a sexual distinction. The male
of <i>Synagris cornuta</i>, a kind of wasp, is still more conspicuous
in this respect; for from the upper side of the base
of its straight slender mandibles proceed a pair of crooked,
decurved, tortuous, sharp horns, not only longer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the mandible, but than the head itself<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>. Many sexual
differences are observable in the mandibles of the various
tribes of bees (<i>Anthophila</i> Latr.). Thus, in <i>Colletes</i>
Latr. the <i>male</i> mandible is more distinctly bidentate at
the apex than the female<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>: in <i>Sphecodes</i> Latr. and others,
the reverse of this takes place<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>. Where these organs in
both sexes are toothed at the apex, they often vary in the
number of teeth. Thus, the female of <i>Megachile centuncularis</i>
Latr. has four teeth at the apex of its mandible,
while the male has only two<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>. In <i>M. Willughbiella</i>,
though the mandibles of both sexes have four teeth, yet
those of the male are sharp, and the two external ones
the longest; while those of his mate are obtuse, and all
nearly equal in length<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>. In <i>Anthidium manicatum</i> Latr.,
the former has only three teeth, while the latter has five<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>.
The differences in this respect in the hive-bee have been
before noticed<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>; those of the humble-bees (<i>Bombus</i> Latr.)
are strikingly distinguished from each other; the female
mandible being very stout and wide, constricted in the
middle, and furrowed on its outer surface; and the male,
on the contrary, very slender at the apex, dilated at the
base, and without furrows<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>.</p>

<p>Of all the organs of the head, none seem so little subject
to <i>sexual</i> variation as the under-jaws (<i>maxillÃ¦</i>)<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
can bring forward only one striking instance of it, and
some degree of doubt rests even upon that. In the genus
<i>Nemognatha</i> of Illiger, the maxillÃ¦ of the male are elongated,
narrow, setiform, and often involute or spiral, like
those of a bee or a butterfly. But that this is peculiar
to the males is at present only surmised<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>. I possess several
species of the genus, all of which are distinguished
by long maxillÃ¦; though in some they are as long as
the body, and in others scarcely half that length. <i>Gnathium</i>
Kirby is similarly characterized<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>maxillary palpi</i> occasionally differ in the sexes.
In <i>Cerocoma</i> those of the female are filiform, while the
two intermediate joints of those of the other sex are much
thicker than the first and the last<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>. In <i>HylÃ¦cetus</i> and
<i>Lymexylon</i>, those of the male are still more remarkable:
they are pendent, the last joint very large, and laciniated
so as to form a tuft<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>. The female ones grow gradually
larger towards the end, but are not at all divided there<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>.
The palpi of male spiders are of a very different structure
from those of the other sex, terminating in a very
complex incrassated piece, which has been supposed to
contain the organ of generation; but this, according
to Treviranus, is a mistaken idea&mdash;that organ being, as
usual, to be found in the abdomen<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>. In the common
gnat the palpi of the male are as long as the proboscis,
consist of five joints, and at the end are tufted with hairs;
while those of the female are scarcely one-fourth of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
length, have only three joints, and are not tufted. Whether
the <i>labial palpi</i> in any genus differ in the sexes, I
cannot affirm with certainty: I have not, however, observed
any such variation in them.</p>

<p>I shall next mention some organs of the head, in which
the difference between the sexes is often very striking
and peculiar. You will readily conjecture that I am
speaking of the <i>antennÃ¦</i>. And here the advantage seems
wholly on the side of the males: since in them these
wonderful instruments of unknown sensations are not
only more complex, but usually more elegant, than
those of the other sex. You will pardon me, therefore,
if I enlarge a little more than ordinary upon a subject so
full of interest, and say something upon the differences
observable between the sexes&mdash;in the shape, magnitude,
and length, number of articulations, ramification and
plumage, and individual joints of their antennÃ¦.</p>

<p>With regard to their <i>shape</i>, variations are sometimes
observable between the antennÃ¦ of the sexes; but this
principally occurs in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> order. For instance,
those of <i>Chelostoma maxillosa</i>, a small bee that
deposits its eggs in little holes in posts and rails, are clavate
in the female and filiform in the male<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>&mdash;a circumstance
that distinguishes in some degree those of <i>Sphecodes</i>,
<i>Halictus</i>, and <i>Andrena</i> of Latreille, three other
genera of wild-bees<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>. In <i>Dinetus</i> Jur. the male antennÃ¦
are moniliform at the base, and filiform at the apex; the
female, on the contrary, are entirely filiform<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>The antennÃ¦ of the sexes also sometimes differ in
<i>magnitude</i> and <i>length</i>. This is the case in the three genera
of wild bees just mentioned; those of the female being
thicker than those of the male, while these last are
longer than the former. But in this tribe the males of
the Fabrician genus <i>Eucera</i> are most remarkable for their
long antennÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>. With regard to the different length of
these organs in the sexes, no insects are more distinguished
than some species of the capricorn-beetles (<i>Cerambyx</i> L.).
In <i>Lamia Sutor</i> the male antennÃ¦ are twice the length of
the female; and in another Brazilian species in my cabinet,
related to <i>L. annulata</i> (<i>Stenocorus</i> F.), they are thrice
their length. Some of the <i>Anthribi</i> F. approach the
<i>CerambycidÃ¦</i>, not only in some other characters, but also
in this circumstance:&mdash;thus the antennÃ¦ of <i>A. albinus</i>, a
native of Britain, are vastly longer in the male than in
the female; and in <i>A. cinereus</i> (<i>Macrocephalus</i> Oliv.)<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>,
which I suspect to be of the former sex, they are as long
nearly as is usual in the tribe just named, called in France
capricorn-beetles.</p>

<p>I may here observe, that sometimes in the sexes a difference
is also to be found in the <i>direction</i> or flexure of
their antennÃ¦. Thus in <i>Scolia</i> F., <i>Pepsis</i> F. &amp;c., in the
males the antennÃ¦ are nearly straight, but in the females
convolute or subspiral. The reverse of this takes place
in <i>Epipone spinipes</i>, a kind of wasp, and its affinities; and
<i>Systropha</i> Illig., a kind of bee: for in these the male antenna
is convolute at the apex<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>, and the female straight.
In the various tribes of bees (<i>Anthophila</i> Latr.), these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
organs in the latter are what is denominated <i>broken</i>, the
main body of the antenna forming an angle with the first
joints: but in the former this does not take place.</p>

<p>The antennas of the sexes do not always agree in the
<i>number</i> of joints. In the bees, and many other <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
the male has one more joint than the female; as is
the case also in <i>&#338;demera notata</i> (<i>Cantharis acuta</i> Marsh.).
In <i>Pteronus Laricis</i>, a kind of saw-fly, the latter has only
sixteen joints in its antennÃ¦, while the former has twenty-four<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>.
In <i>Rhipicera marginata</i>, a beetle, the beautiful
antennÃ¦ of the male consist of thirty-two joints, while
the female has no more than eleven! In <i>Chelonus</i> Jur.
the male, on the contrary, has the smallest number of
joints, namely sixteen; while the female has twenty-five<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>.</p>

<p>In nothing do the sexes differ more materially than in
the <i>ramification</i> of these organs, and their <i>plumage</i>. By
attending to this, you may often detect the sexes in an
instant; since the antennÃ¦ of the males in numerous instances
are much more complex than those of the females.
For what end the Creator has so distinguished them is not
quite clear; but most probably this complex structure is
for the purpose of receiving from the atmosphere information
of the station of the female. A tendency to branching
will be found in the antennÃ¦ of some males, in tribes where
these organs are usually perfectly simple in both sexes.
Thus, in the male of <i>Chelostoma maxillosa</i>,&mdash;mistaken for
another species by LinnÃ©, which he names <i>Apis florisomnis</i>,&mdash;the
intermediate joints on their inner side project
into an angle<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>; and those of the same sex of the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
hornet, by means of a central sinus, have two obtuse
teeth on each. With regard to more direct ramifications,
some male antennÃ¦ terminate in a fork, or two
branches. This is the case with <i>Hylotoma furcata</i> Latr.,
a saw-fly<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>; and the peacock-louse (<i>Nirmus Pavonis</i>
Herm.)<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>. Others, again, have three lateral branches,
as in <i>Eulophus</i> Geoffr. a little parasite, the male antennÃ¦
of which send forth a hairy external and rather long
branch, from the base of the fourth, fifth, and sixth
joints<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>. In <i>Elater flabellicornis</i> L., the eight last joints
are flabellate, or elongated and flat, resembling the sticks
of a fan in the male<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>; in the female they are shorter, and
more properly may take their denomination from the
teeth of a comb. In <i>Lampyris Latreillii</i> Kirby, the antennÃ¦
of the former are flabellate on both sides, while
those of the latter are little more than serrate<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>. These
organs are extremely beautiful in the males of the <i>RhipicerÃ¦</i>
of Latreille. In <i>R. marginata</i> K. they consist of
thirty-two joints, from thirty of which issues a branch,
the first very short, but the rest gradually increasing in
length as they approach the middle of the antenna; then
gradually decreasing to the end, so as to represent an
expanded fan<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>. But in none are they altogether so remarkable
as in those moths that LinnÃ© denominates
<i>Bombyces Attaci</i>, and some others. In these, in the males,
these organs in their contour are lanceolate, and every
joint is furnished with a couple of parallel equal branches
on each side<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>. In the females these branches are shorter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
on the whole, and alternately one long and one short; but
in some, as <i>Saturnia Pavonia</i>, there is only one short
branch or tooth on each joint in this sex<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>. In <i>Bombyx regalis</i>
&amp;c. only the first part of the antenna is so branched;
and those of the female are setaceous and without branches.
In <i>B. versicolor</i>, &amp;c. there is only one branch from each
side on every joint; those of the female being much
shorter than those of the male. The latter sex of <i>Pteronus
Laricis</i> Jur., a saw-fly, afford an example of a different
structure, the antennÃ¦ on one side sending forth
a branch from every joint but the two first; but on the
other side, the nine or ten last joints also are without a
branch. The female antenna is serrated<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>. In another
of this tribe, <i>Pterygopterus cinctus</i> Klug, the male antenna
resembles a single-toothed comb, being branched
only on one side: that of the female, like the former instance,
is serrated<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>. Whether the remarkable antennÃ¦
that distinguish the known individuals of the genus <i>Phengodes</i>
(<i>Lampyris plumosa</i> F.) is a sexual character has
not been ascertained; but it is not improbable that it
may be, as in other <i>LampyridÃ¦</i>. A pair of delicate
flexile and almost convolute plumose branches proceeds
from the apex of each joint except the basal ones, which
have something the air of cirri, and give a more than
usual degree of lightness and elegance to these organs<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>.
Other antennÃ¦, especially in the <i>Diptera</i> order, assume
an appearance of <i>plumes</i>&mdash;not from the branches that proceed
from them, but from the fine long hairs that beset
and adorn them. These are universally indications of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
male sex, those of the females being generally comparatively
naked. If you take the common gnat, you will
find that the antennÃ¦ of one individual are thickly fringed
on each side, and tufted at the end with fine long hairs,
while in the other only four or five placed at intervals in
a whorl are to be perceived<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>. In <i>Chironomus</i> Meig., a
kind of <i>Tipula</i> L., resembling a gnat, the male antennÃ¦
are beset on all sides with the finest hairs, and resemble
a beautiful plume<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>, while the females to the unarmed
eye appear naked. Even in some <i>Hymenoptera</i>, the antennÃ¦
of the males are thus feathered, in a less degree:
for instance, in <i>Hylotoma</i> Latr.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Whether the tufts
and fringes which ornament, in a remarkable manner,
the antennÃ¦ of many <i>CerambycidÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>, are sexual characters,
is not certainly known.</p>

<p>We are now to consider other sexual differences in
these organs, resulting from the size or configuration of
one or more <i>individual joints</i>. To begin with the first
joint, or scapus. In many of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, particularly
the <i>Anthophila</i> Latr., this is elongated, and the remaining
joints form an angle with it in the females: while
in the other sex it is much shorter, and in the same line
with the rest of the antennÃ¦; and in <i>HylÃ¦us dilatatus</i>
(<i>Melitta dilatata</i> Kirby) the first joint in the male is dilated
and shaped something like a patella<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>. In <i>Malachius
bipustulatus</i>, &amp;c. the sex just mentioned is peculiarly
distinguished by a white excrescence on the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
four joints of the organs in question, most conspicuous
in the second and fourth. The antennÃ¦ of male <i>CerocomÃ¦</i>
are not very different<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>. Mr. Marsham has described
a little <i>Haltica</i> under the name of <i>Chrysomela
nodicornis</i>, from a peculiarity of the same sex not to be
found in the other. The fourth joint is very large and
obtriangular; in the female it is merely longer than the
rest. In <i>H. BrassicÃ¦</i> and <i>quadripustulata</i> the fifth joint
is larger and longer than all but the first in the male, in
their females it is only longer. In some moths (<i>Herminia</i>
Latr., <i>Crambus</i> F.) there is also a knot in the middle
of the male antennÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>. In <i>Noterus</i>, a water-beetle, the
six intermediate joints are thicker than the rest, beginning
from the fourth, and the last but one ends internally
in a truncated tooth. The fifth and two following joints
in the male antennÃ¦ of <i>Meloe</i> are larger than the rest,
which distinguishes them, as well as a remarkable bend
observable at that part<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>.</p>

<p>Variations of the kind we are considering are also observable
in the <i>clava</i>, or knob, in which antennÃ¦ often
terminate. You have doubtless observed that the lamellated
clava of the antennÃ¦ of the common cockchafer
is much longer and more conspicuous in some individuals
than in others&mdash;the long clava belongs to the male<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>. In
another species, <i>M. Fullo</i>, that of this sex is nine or ten
times the length of that of the other. In <i>Colymbetes
serricornis</i>, a water-beetle, the male has a serrated clava
of four joints. In <i>Dorcatoma dresdensis</i><a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>, and also <i>Enoplium
damicorne</i>, two beetles, it is nearly branched in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
male, but much less so in the female. In a little destructive
beetle, common in our houses (<i>Attagenus Pellio</i>),
in the latter it is very short, but in the former it is very
long, and nearly formed by a single joint. In <i>Eurhinus</i>
Kirby, a New Holland genus of the weevil-tribe, in the
male the last joint, also, is much longer than it is in the
female<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>. These examples will give you some idea of the
principal variations that take place in the antennÃ¦ of the
sexes, and of the wonderful diversity of forms in this respect
to which mere sexuality gives rise amongst insects.</p>

<p>In the <i>eyes</i>, or <i>stemmata</i>, this diversity is less remarkable.
Latreille has described two ants, <i>Formica contracta</i> and
<i>coeca</i>, in the neuter of which he could discover no eyes<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>:
in the former, the female, however, had large ones. The
male he appears not to have known, but it probably was
not destitute of these organs; of the latter he was acquainted
only with the workers. The neuter of <i>Myrmica
rubra</i>, another ant, has no ocelli or stemmata,
although the male and female are provided with them<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>.
They are discoverable only in the former sex of that singular
insect related to the ants, <i>Mutilla europÃ¦a</i>. Other
insects differ in the <i>size</i> of the eyes of their sexes. In
the hive-bee, and some <i>EphemerÃ¦</i>, the eyes of the drone
or male are much larger than those of the worker and
female, and also meet at the vertex, having their stemmata
below the conflux; whereas in these latter they are
widely distant<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>. In <i>Stratyomis</i>, <i>Tabanus</i>, and many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
two-winged flies, the <i>male</i> eyes meet at some point below
the stemmata, and above the antennÃ¦. In the former
they touch more at an angle; for the vertex forming a
narrow isosceles triangle, and for the anterior part of the
face one nearly equilateral: while those of the <i>female</i> are
separated by a considerable interval. In <i>Heptatoma</i>
and <i>HÃ¦matopota</i> in that sex, a similar interval obtains;
while in the other, after forming a minute short triangle,
they unite for a considerable space, and then diverging,
form the face. This is also the case in <i>Tabanus</i>; but in
the female, the space that intervenes between the posterior
part of the eyes is much narrower than in these two
cognate genera of the horse-flies. In some others of
this order, as <i>Musca</i> Latr., the eyes of the male do not
touch, but approach posteriorly much nearer to each
other than those of the other sex. In a few instances
the sexes vary even in the number of their eyes, as well
as the size. This occurs in some species of <i>Ephemera</i> L.
(<i>E. diptera</i>, &amp;c.), in which the male, besides the common
lateral ones, has two large and striking intermediate
eyes, that sit upon vertical pillars or footstalks<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Trunk</i>. The thorax of many coleopterous
males, especially of the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i> and <i>CopridÃ¦</i> amongst
the petalocerous tribes, exhibits very striking differences
from that of the female. In many <i>Lucani</i> the lateral
angle is more prominent. In <i>Anthia</i> it is bilobed posteriorly,
while in the last-mentioned sex it is entire<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>. In
<i>PhanÃ¦us carnifex</i> MacLeay (<i>Copris</i> F.) it is elevated into
a plane triangular space, with the vertex of the triangle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
pointing to the head; but in the female it is convex, with
an anterior abbreviated transverse ridge<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>.</p>

<p>In a large proportion terrific <i>horns</i>, often hollow, like
those of the head lately noticed, arm the thorax of the
male, of which you will usually only discover the rudiments
in the other sex. In the first place, some are <i>unicorns</i>,
or armed only with a <i>single</i> thoracic horn, which
frequently, in conjunction with the thorax itself, not a little
resembles a tunnel reversed: of this description are <i>Dynastes
Hercules</i>, <i>Tityus</i>, <i>Gedeon</i>, <i>Enema</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> In the
three first this horn is porrected, or nearly in the same line
with the body; but in the last, and <i>D. Pan</i>, it forms an
angle with it; and in <i>D. Ãgeon</i> it is nearly vertical<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>.
In <i>D. Hercules</i> it is very long; in <i>D. Alcides</i><a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> and <i>Tityus</i>
very short; in the two last, and in <i>Oxytelus tricornis</i>
which is similarly armed, it is undivided at the apex;
but in <i>D. Gedeon</i>, <i>Pan</i>, <i>bilobus</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> it is bifid or bilobed.
It is usually rather slender, but in <i>D. ChorinÃ¦us</i><a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> and
<i>bilobus</i>, it is very stout and wide. In <i>D. claviger</i> it is
hastate at the apex<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>. In <i>D. hastatus</i> it is short and
truncated<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>. Others, again, have <i>two</i> thoracic horns.
In <i>Copris nemestrinus</i> these are discoidal, diverging, and
inclining forwards<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>. In <i>PhanÃ¦us floriger</i><a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> they are lateral,
triangular, and incline towards each other, with, as
it were, a deep basin between them. In <i>P. splendidulus</i>
they sink into two longitudinal ridges, most elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
posteriorly, with an intervening valley<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>. In <i>P. bellicosus</i>
they are posterior, compressed, truncated, and emarginate
at the apex, and include a basin<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>. In <i>Copris SabÃ¦us</i>
they are merely two acute prominences<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>.&mdash;<i>Three</i> horns
distinguish the thorax of many. In <i>D. Aloeus</i><a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> and its
affinities, they are arranged in a triangle, whose vertex
is towards the head. In <i>D. AntÃ¦us</i><a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> these horns are
nearly equal in length, and undivided at the apex. In
<i>D. Titanus</i><a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> the anterior horn is longer than the rest,
and bifid at the apex; in <i>D. Atlas</i> and <i>Endymion</i><a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>, both
of which have a horn on the head, it is much shorter.
In others, as in <i>Megasoma</i> Kirby, the vertex of the triangle
is towards the anus. In <i>M. Typhon</i><a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> it is longer
than the anterior ones, and bifid at the apex; in <i>M. lanigerum</i>
they are equal in length<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>. In <i>M. Elephas</i> and
<i>ActÃ¦on</i><a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> it is merely an elevation of the thorax; in the
last almost obsolete. In <i>Geotrupes TyphÃ¦us</i>, common
on our heaths, the anterior of this part is armed by three
horizontal horns, the intermediate one being the shortest<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>.
<i>Copris lunaris</i> also, another of our own beetles,
has three short posterior thoracic horns, two lateral and
triangular ones, and a transverse intermediate elevation,
with a notch in the middle<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>. In <i>Dynastes Neptunus</i> the
horns are porrected, the middle one being very long, and
the lateral ones short<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>. In <i>D. Geryon</i> the point of the lateral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
horns is towards the anus, and the base of the intermediate
one covers the scutellum<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>. Others have <i>four</i>
of these singular arms: this is the case with one of our
rarest beetles, <i>Bolbocerus mobilicornis</i> K., which has four
dentiform horns, the intermediate pair being the shortest,
arranged in a transverse line on the anterior part of
the thorax<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>. In <i>B. quadridens</i> these are merely teeth.
In <i>PhanÃ¦us Faunus</i><a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> it has two lateral, elongated, compressed,
truncate, horizontal horns, and two intermediate
teeth. <i>Dynastes Milon</i> has a still greater number of
horns on the thorax of the male, there being two lateral
anterior ones and three posterior ones&mdash;the intermediate
being the longest<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>; and <i>Copris Antenor</i> Fabricius and
Olivier describe as having a many-toothed thorax; and
from the figure of the latter<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>, the male appears to have
seven prominences.</p>

<p>But the males of insects are not only occasionally distinguished
by these dorsal arms&mdash;in a few instances they
are also furnished with <i>pectoral</i> ones. The illustrious
traveller Humboldt found in South America a species
of weevil (<i>Cryptorhynchus Spiculator</i> Humb.), the breast
of which was armed with a pair of long projecting horns;
and I possess both sexes of four species, three at least
from Brazil, that exhibit in one individual the same character.
One, concerning the country of which I am uncertain,
recedes somewhat from the type of form of the
rest, and comes very near that of <i>RynchÃ¦nus Strix</i> F.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>
In the individual which I take to be <i>C. Spiculator</i>, the
pectoral horns are very long, curving upwards at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
apex, and nearly in a horizontal position; while in the
three others they are much shorter, and inclined towards
the horizon. The males of some species of <i>Rynchites</i>, as
<i>R. Bacchus</i> and <i>Populi</i><a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>, are also armed with a pair of
lateral horns or spines, which may be termed pectoral
rather than dorsal.</p>

<p>I shall now advert to the sexual characters that are to
be found in the <i>instruments of motion</i> attached to the
trunk&mdash;beginning with those for <i>flight</i>. In the female of
the common glow-worm (<i>Lampyris noctiluca</i>) not the
slightest vestige of elytra or wings is visible, and it resembles
a larva rather than a perfect insect; yet its mate
is a true beetle furnished with both. The same circumstance
distinguishes the female cockroach (<i>Blatta</i>) and
is more universally prevalent in that genus than in <i>Lampyris</i>,
in which a large number of females have both elytra
and wings. The males of <i>Bombyx antiqua</i> and <i>Gonostigma</i>,
and of many other moths, have wings of the usual
ample dimensions, while those of their females are merely
rudiments. This is the case, also, with some of the <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>.
In the tribes of Ants, <i>Termites</i>, &amp;c. the
neuters or workers are without wings. Amongst the
plant-lice (<i>Aphides</i>) there are individuals of both sexes,
some of which have wings, and others not<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>. Amongst
the <i>Coleoptera</i>, the female of <i>Tenebrio Molitor</i>, the common
meal-worm, has elytra and no wings; while the
male has both<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>.&mdash;Sometimes these organs vary in size
in the sexes: thus in <i>Aradus BetulÃ¦</i> F., a kind of bug,
the hemelytra and wings are narrower and shorter in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
female than in the male<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>. In the genus <i>Blaps</i> F., the
mucro that arms the apex of each elytrum is longer in
the former sex than in the latter. In <i>Ateuchus gibbosus</i>
F., a dung-beetle, the elytra have a basal gibbosity
near the suture in one sex that does not obtain in the
other. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> order, the sexes are often to
be known, almost at first sight, by a difference in the
veining and areolets of the wings; but upon this I enlarged
so fully when I treated of the sounds produced by
insects, that it is not necessary to repeat what I have
said; which observation also applies to the drums which
distinguish the male <i>CicadÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>. The wings of some butterflies,
and of most moths and hawkmoths (<i>Sphinx</i> L.),
are furnished with a singular apparatus for keeping them
steady, and the under-wing from passing over the upper
in flight. This appears to have been first noticed by
<i>Moses Harris</i>, and was afterwards more fully explained
by <i>M. Esprit Giorna</i><a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>. From the base of the under-wing
proceeds a strong bristle, received by an annulus or
socket, which springing between the two principal nervures
of the upper-wing terminates in the disk of the
wing: in this annulus the bristle moves to and fro, and
prevents the displacement of the under-wing. This apparatus
is perfect only in the males, which alone have
occasion for long flights; the females, though they have
often several bristles, having no annulus<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>.</p>

<p>The other instruments of motion, the <i>legs</i>, also differ in
the sexes. In some instances they are disproportionably
long. This is particularly the case with the <i>anterior</i> pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
of some beetles, as <i>Macropus longimanus</i>, <i>ScarabÃ¦us longimanus</i>
L., in which they are so long as to make the males
of these individuals rather inconvenient in a cabinet.
Amongst British beetles <i>Clytra longimana</i> and <i>Curculio
longimanus</i> Marsh. are also remarkable in this respect.
In some other males the <i>middle</i> pair are the longest; as in
<i>Anthophora retusa</i> Latr., a kind of wild-bee<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>. There are
two known instances of remarkably long <i>posterior</i> legs in
the Capricorn tribe, which I suspect belong to the present
head. One is <i>Saperda hirtipes</i> Oliv.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>, in which the hind-legs
are longer than the whole body, and adorned with a singular
tuft of hairs; and the other a <i>Clytus</i>, I think, which
Mr. MacLeay purchased from the late Mr. Marsham's
collection, in which the hind-legs are not only very long,
but have tarsi convolute, like some antennÃ¦. From analogy
I should affirm that these were the characters of
<i>male</i> insects.</p>

<p>To come to the <i>parts</i> of legs. Sometimes the <i>coxÃ¦</i> of
the last mentioned sex are distinguished from those of
the female by being armed by a <i>mucro</i> or spine. Thus
the male of <i>Megachile Willughbiella</i>, and others of that
tribe, have such a spine on the inner sides of the anterior
coxa<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>. The <i>Trochanter</i> also of some differs sexually;
and you will find that the posterior one of the male in
<i>Anthidium manicatum</i> is of a different shape from what
it is in the female<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>. In <i>Sphodrus leucopththalmus</i>, one of
the beetles called <i>black dors</i>, in one sex the same trochanter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
terminates in a long mucro or spine<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a>, and in the
other it is rounded at the apex.</p>

<p>Peculiar characters in their <i>thighs</i> also often indicate
different sexes. In <i>Prionus damicornis</i> there is a short
spine at the apex of the <i>anterior</i> ones in the female that
is not in the male; while in <i>Macropus longimanus</i>, at their
base externally the male is armed with a mucro, which I
cannot find in the female<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>. In <i>ScarabÃ¦us longimanus</i> L.
this thigh is furnished with two teeth<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a>.&mdash;The <i>intermediate</i>
thighs also sometimes differ. In an <i>Onitis</i> from
China, a variety perhaps of <i>O. Sphinx,</i> those in the male
are dolabriform, and in the other sex of the ordinary
shape. In <i>Odynerus spinipes</i> they have on their lower
side two sinuses, so as to give them the appearance of
being toothed. The <i>posterior</i> thighs are sometimes incrassated
in the male, and not in the female. This you
will see in a weevil, not uncommon, <i>Apoderus BetulÃ¦,</i>
and also in many species of <i>Cimbex</i> F., a kind of saw-fly;
and the same circumstance distinguishes the latter sex in
many species of <i>LygÃ¦us</i> F., a kind of bug: I discovered
this from <i>L. cruciger</i>, of which I have both the sexes; and
from Stoll's figure of <i>L. Pharaonis</i><a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>. In some of these
the female thighs are enormously large. A remarkable
variation in this respect is observable in the coleopterous
genus <i>&#338;demera</i> (<i>Necydalis</i> L.). In <i>&#338;. PodagrariÃ¦</i> these
limbs are incrassated in one sex and not in the other<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>;
in <i>&#338;. cÃ¦rulea</i> they are so in both sexes; and in <i>&#338;. ceramboides</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
in neither. In <i>Pelecinus Polycerator</i> F., one of
the Ichneumon tribe, or an insect very near it from Brazil,
these thighs in the female are armed with two spines
underneath, which are not in the male.</p>

<p>The <i>anterior tibiÃ¦</i> in <i>ScarabÃ¦us longimanus</i> L. differ
remarkably in the sexes. In the female they are of the
ordinary shape, and serrated externally; but in the male
they are very long, incurved, and without teeth or serratures<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>.
In the males of the genus <i>Onitis</i> F. they are bent
like a bow, and acute at the end; but in the females they
are formed on the common type<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a>. In <i>Hispa spinipes</i> F.
they are armed internally with a crooked spine<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>. But
the most extraordinary sexual variation of this joint of
the leg may be seen in the male of <i>Crabro cribarius</i> F.
and several other species of the same family, in which
these tibiÃ¦ are dilated externally into a concavo-convex
plate, or rather have one fixed to them and part of the
thigh, of an irregular and somewhat angular shape<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>,
with numerous transparent dots, so as not badly to resemble
a sieve: whence the trivial name of the species.
Rolander, who first described it, fancied that this plate
was really perforated, and that by means of it the animal
actually sifted the pollen; but it is most probably for
sexual purposes. In another species, the plate is ornamented
with transparent converging streaks. In the
bee-tribes (<i>Anthophila</i> Latr.) the <i>posterior</i> tibia of the
working sex is generally bigger than the corresponding
part in their more idle partners: this is particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
conspicuous in the genus <i>Euglossa</i>, in the females of which
this part is triangular, very broad towards the apex, and
fitted for carrying a large mass of pollen paste. The
tibiÃ¦ of the <i>males</i> of some <i>Lepidoptera</i> are remarkable in
this respect. That of <i>Hepialus Humuli</i> is much more
hairy; but in <i>H. Hectus</i> it is a dilated mis-shapen mass,
without a tarsus, and with long scales pendent from the
disk<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>. Differences of this kind also occur in the <i>calcaria</i>
or spurs that arm the apex of the tibiÃ¦ of a large number
of insects. Thus in <i>Acanthopus</i> Klug, a singular
bee, in the male the spur of the intermediate leg is dilated
at the apex, and armed with six strong spines, the inner
one larger than the rest<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>.</p>

<p>But the part of the leg in which the sexes most vary
is the <i>tarsus</i>; and this variation takes place both in the
number of the joints, and their form and circumstances.
The first case has been observed only with regard to certain
species of <i>Cryptophagus</i> Herbst, as <i>C. fumatus</i>, &amp;c.
in which the female is <i>pentamerous</i>, or having <i>five</i> joints
in all the tarsi; and the male <i>heteromerous</i>, or having <i>five</i>
joints in the two <i>anterior</i> pairs, and only <i>four</i> in the
<i>posterior</i><a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>. With respect to the form of the tarsal joints,
the sexes more frequently differ; and by inspecting this
part, especially in the predaceous and carnivorous <i>Coleoptera</i>,
you may often, without further examination,
ascertain whether any individual is male or female.
Even in the slender-footed <i>CicindelidÃ¦</i>, the three first
joints of the anterior tarsus of the male are more dilated
than the two last, and covered underneath with a brush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of stiffish hair; in the female all are equally slender, and
not so hairy. In <i>Carabus</i>, <i>Feronia</i>, &amp;c. Latr. the <i>four</i> first
joints of these tarsi in the males are dilated, and furnished
with a brush or cushion: in the <i>SilphidÃ¦</i>, also, the same
circumstance takes place. In <i>Harpalus</i> Latr., and <i>Silpha
americana</i>, the <i>four</i> anterior ones are similarly formed
in this respect. But one of the most remarkable sexual
characters, in this tribe of insects, that distinguish the
males, are those orbicular patellÃ¦, furnished below with
suckers of various sizes, and formed by the three first
joints of the tarsus, which are to be met with in the <i>DytiscidÃ¦</i>,
&amp;c.; but as I shall have occasion to treat of these
more fully in another Letter, I shall only allude to them
now. The second pair of tarsi have in these also the
three first joints dilated and cushioned<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>. In <i>Hydrophilus
piceus</i>, another water-beetle, the fifth joint of the
tarsus is dilated externally, so as to form nearly an equilateral
triangle<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a>. Christian, a German writer on the <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
has described some very singular appendages
which he observed on the first joint of the four posterior
tarsi of <i>Xylocopa latipes</i> F. These were battledore-shaped
membranaceous laminÃ¦, with a reticulated surface,
of a pale colour; which were fixed in pairs by the
intervention of a footstalk to the above joint, on which
they sometimes amounted to more than a hundred: the
use of which, he conjectures, is the collection of pollen<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a>.
I possess two specimens of this bee; one has none of
these appendages, and on the other I can discover them
only in one of the tarsi&mdash;from which circumstance I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
led to conjecture that, like the supposed <i>ClavariÃ¦</i> that
were imagined to grow on some humble-bees, but which
are now ascertained to be the anthers of flowers&mdash;these
also belong to the kingdom of Flora, and are spoils which
the bee in question has filched from the blossom of some
plant. The individuals that have been thus circumstanced
are males; whether the female is guilty of similar
spoliations is not known. In my specimen there are
no traces of them. In many bees, the first joint of the
posterior tarsi is much larger in the females and workers
than in the males; but in the hive-bee this joint is largest
in the latter<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>. In <i>Beris clavipes</i> and <i>Empis nigra</i>,
two flies, the joint in question is large and thick in the
male, but slender in the female. The penultimate tarsal
joint in the posterior legs is dilated internally, and terminates
in a mucro in one sex of <i>Anoplognathus Dytiscoides</i>
of Mr. W. MacLeay<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>. In some insects the anterior
tarsus of the males has been supposed to be altogether
wanting: I allude to the petalocerous genus <i>Onitis</i> F.;
but I have a specimen of <i>Onitis Apelles</i> of this sex, or a
species nearly related to it, in which one of these tarsi
is to be found<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>; which, though very slender, consists of
five joints, and is armed with a double claw: from which
circumstance it may, I think, be concluded, that although,
as in <i>PhanÃ¦us</i>, these tarsi are very minute, they are not
wanting. What renders this more probable is, a circumstance
which every collector of insects, who has many
specimens of Mr. W. MacLeay's <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> in his cabinet,
must have noticed: namely, that in all, except <i>Copris</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
and <i>Onthophagus</i>, the anterior tarsi are usually broken
off. Out of seventeen individuals of <i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> MacLeay
in my own, not a single one has a relic of an anterior tarsus;
and scarcely one in a much greater number of <i>PhanÃ¦i</i>.
The tarsus in question in the nobler sex in <i>Crabro</i>,
at least in <i>C. cribrarius</i> and its affinities, is also very short,
especially the three intermediate joints; but at the same
time very broad and flat. In the species just named, the
external claw forms a kind of hook; and in the rest it is
considerably longer than the other<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>. The <i>claws</i>, indeed,
occasionally vary in the sexes in other <i>Hymenoptera</i>:
thus in <i>Melecta</i> Latr., a kind of bee, in the female they
are intire, but in the male they are furnished with an internal
submembranaceous tooth or process<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>. In <i>C&#339;lioxys
conica</i> and others, those of the latter sex are bifid at
the apex, but those of the former acute<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>. In <i>Megachile</i>,
the male claw is as in the instance just mentioned, while
the female has a lateral tooth<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>; and a similar character
distinguishes the sexes in the hive-bee<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a>.</p>

<p>3. The <i>abdomen</i>. This part affords many external
sexual characters, whether we consider its general shape;
the number of segments that compose it; its base, middle,
or extremity.</p>

<p>In general <i>shape</i> it often differs in the sexes. Thus,
the abdomen of female <i>TipulÃ¦</i> is lanceolate; that of the
male cylindrical, and thickest at the extremity<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
<i>Molorchus</i> F. it is convex above in the former, and flat
in the latter,&mdash;the female of this beetle not unaptly representing
some female <i>Ichneumons</i> in this respect, and the
male their males<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>. In <i>Andrena</i> it is oblong in the one,
and lanceolate in the other. In the hive-bee the drones
have a thick, obtuse, and rather long abdomen; in the
females it is long, and nearly represents an inverted cone;
and in the workers a three-sided figure, or prism.</p>

<p>The <i>number of segments</i>, also, is generally different in
the two sexes&mdash;the male having one more than the female;
but in <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>, &amp;c. the reverse of this takes
place: the female, if you reckon the bipartite half-concealed
anal segment as one, having seven ventral segments,
and the male only six. She has also eight dorsal,
and the male seven.&mdash;In the ant tribes (<i>Formica</i> L.), the
little vertical scale, at the <i>base</i> of the abdomen in one
description of them, or the double knot in another, is
less in the male than in the female. In a very singular
male insect belonging to the <i>VespidÃ¦</i>, and related to <i>Synagris</i>,
(which I purchased from the late Mr. Drury's cabinet,)
the second ventral segment sends forth from its
disk two remarkable parallel very acute and rather long
spines. The same sex of <i>Chelostoma maxillosa</i> has likewise
on the same segment a concave elevation, opposite
to which on the fifth is a cavity which receives it, when
the animal rolls itself up to take its repose<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>. In another
species, <i>C. Campanularum</i>, the segment in question has
only a tubercle<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>.</p>

<p>On the second segment of the abdomen of some specimens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
probably males, of the remarkable African genus
<i>Pneumora</i> before alluded to<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a>, there are thirteen little
elevated ridges, placed rather obliquely in an oblique
series; and gradually, though slightly, diminishing in
size towards the belly: on their upper side they are flat,
forming nearly a horizontal ledge, but on the lower they
slope to the abdomen. The posterior thigh in its natural
position covers the three first of them, and, if moved
downwards, would strike them all<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>. I conjecture, therefore,
that these are the animal's instruments of sound,
imitating the harp or violin rather than the drum; and
that the thigh acts the part of the hand or bow. The
abdomen of these insects being blown out like a bladder,
and almost empty<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a>, must emit a considerable sound when
the thigh of the animal passes briskly over these ridges;
and their different length would produce a modulation
in the sound. When struck with a pin, they emit a grating
noise.</p>

<p>In <i>Staphylinus splendens</i>, the <i>penultimate</i> ventral segment
is very deeply cleft, and the antepenultimate emarginate
in one sex, and intire in the other. In <i>S. laminatus</i>,
an allied species, the penultimate segment is cleft,
less deeply, however; but the antepenultimate is very
short and intire; while the fourth is extremely long, and
rounded at the margin, appearing as if it was only an
elevated part of the last-mentioned segment; for which
it was mistaken by Gravenhorst<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>, while it is of the usual
form in the other sex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>extremity</i> of the abdomen or its <i>anal</i> segments
and organs furnish a variety of sexual characters. Sometimes
the last dorsal segment is emarginate in the male,
and not in the female; as in <i>Megachile ligniseca</i>, one of
the leaf-cutter bees, <i>Cimex hÃ¦morrhoidalis</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> At
other times little lateral teeth are added to this notch, as
in another of the same tribe, <i>M. Willughbiella</i><a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>. Again,
in other males, both the ventral and dorsal anal segment
are armed each with a pair of teeth or mucros, as in
<i>Chelostoma maxillosa</i><a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a>. In <i>Anthidium manicatum</i>, another
bee, the anus terminates in five spines<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>. In <i>C&#339;lioxys
conica</i> of the same tribe, in which this part in the
female is very acute, that of the male is armed with six
points<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>. In that singular Neuropterous genus <i>Panorpa</i>,
while the abdomen of the female is of the ordinary form,
with a pair of biarticulate palpiform organs attached to the
last retractile joint, or ovipositor, that of the male terminates
in a jointed tail, not unlike a scorpion's, at the end
of which is an incrassated joint armed with a forceps<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>. In
the common earwig (<i>Forficula auricularia</i>) the two sexes
differ considerably in their anal forceps: in one it is armed
with internal teeth at the base, and suddenly dilated, above
which dilatation it is bent like a bow: in the other it is
smaller, without teeth, grows gradually narrower, is
very minutely crenulate from the base to the end, and is
straight, except at the very summit, where it curves inwards.
Misled by these and similar differences, Mr. Marsham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
has considered them (the sexes both of <i>F. auricularia</i>
and <i>F. minor</i>) as distinct species.</p>

<p>The tail of some species of the genus <i>Ephemera</i> is furnished
with three long, jointed, hairy bristles. We learn
from Reaumur with respect to one, that though in the
female these are all equal in length, yet in the male there
is only a rudiment of the third. On the belly near the
anus these males have four fleshy appendages, the posterior
ones setaceous and long, and the anterior pair filiform
and shorter. They are supposed to represent the
anal forceps of other insects<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>. In <i>Ephemera vulgata</i>,
described by De Geer, both sexes have three bristles,
but those of the male are the longest; and he describes
the forceps as consisting of only a pair of jointed pieces,
forming a bow not unlike the forceps of an earwig<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a>.</p>


<p>v. All the differences I have hitherto noticed between
the sexes of insects occur in their <i>bodily</i> structure; but
there are others of a somewhat higher description observable
in their <i>character</i>. You may smile at the idea
of character in beings so minute; but if you recollect what
I formerly related to you when treating upon the societies
of insects, you will allow that something of this kind
does take place amongst them. In general the males are
more fitted for locomotion and more locomotive; and
the females, on the contrary, are necessarily more stationary.
And this for an obvious reason:&mdash;the law is,
that the male shall seek the female, and therefore he is
peculiarly gifted for this purpose, both in his organs of
sensation and motion: while his partner in many cases
has very simple antennÃ¦, he has very complex ones; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
while she has either no wings or only rudiments of them,
he is amply provided with them. Again: amongst the
insects that suck the blood of man or beast, such as the
gnat (<i>Culex</i>) or horse-flies (<i>TabanidÃ¦</i>), it is the female
alone that is bloodthirsty, the males contenting themselves
with the nectar of flowers<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a>. But the difference of
character in the sexes is most conspicuous, at least it has
been more noticed, in those that live in societies, and is
quite the reverse of what takes place in the human species.
While the females and workers (which are now
generally considered as sterile females, in which the ovaries
are not developed) are laborious and active, diligent
and skilful, wise and prudent, courageous and warlike;&mdash;the
males, on the contrary, take no part in promoting the
common weal, except merely a sexual one. Though till
a certain period they are supported at the expense of the
community, they take no part in its labours, either in
collecting and forming the public stores, or in feeding
and attending the young. They are idle, cowardly, and
inactive; have neither art nor skill of any kind, and
are unprovided with the usual offensive weapons of their
species. These observations in their full force apply particularly
to the hive-bee, and partially to the other social
insects; amongst which, if you consult my former communications,
there are some exceptions to this slothful
character in the males<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>.</p>


<p>II. <i>Age.</i> There is less diversity in the duration of the
lives of insects in their perfect than in their larva or pupa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
state. Some, like several species of <i>EphemerÃ¦</i>, live only
a few hours; some never even see the sun<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>: others, as
flies, moths, and butterflies, and indeed the majority of
insects, a few days or weeks; and a comparatively small
number, such as some of the larger <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>,
&amp;c., six, nine, twelve, or fifteen months&mdash;a period
beyond which the life of perfect insects rarely extends.
Some, however, certainly enjoy a longer existence in the
perfect state. Mr. Baker kept one of the darkling beetles
(<i>Blaps Mortisaga</i>) alive under a glass upwards of three
years. The rose-beetle (<i>Cetonia aurata</i>), RÃ¶sel informs
us he fed with fruit and moist white bread for as long a
period<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>. Esper kept our most common water-beetle
(<i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>) in water in a large glass vessel,
feeding it with meat, for three years and a half<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>. With
regard to the <i>Arachnida</i>, from the very slow growth of
<i>Scorpio europÃ¦us</i>, RÃ¶sel suspects that it must live two
or three years; and Audebert is stated to have kept a
spider for several<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>. In this respect insects follow a law
very different from that which obtains amongst vertebrate
animals. In these the duration of their life is in
proportion to the term of their growth: those which attain
to maturity the latest, in almost every case living the
longest. In insects, on the contrary, we often meet with
the very reverse of this rule. Thus the larva of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) is three years, that of the
cabbage-butterfly (<i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>) not three months, in
attaining maturity; yet the perfect insects live equally
long. <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, which in its first state lives
four years, as a beetle lives only eight or ten days<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>.
And some <i>EphemerÃ¦</i>, whose larvÃ¦ have been two years
in acquiring their full size, live only an hour; while the
flesh-fly, whose larva has attained to maturity in three or
four days, will exist several weeks.</p>

<p>There is yet another anomaly in the duration of the
life of perfect insects. This is not, as in larger animals,
a fixed period liable to be shortened only by accident or
disease, and incapable of being prolonged; but an indeterminate
one, whose duration is dependent on the earlier
or later fulfilment of a particular animal function&mdash;that
of propagation. The general law is, that a few days,
or at most weeks, after the union of the sexes, both perish,
the female having first deposited her eggs. If,
therefore, this union takes place immediately after the
disclosure of the insect from the pupa, their existence in
the perfect state will not exceed a few <i>days</i> or <i>weeks</i>, or
in some cases <i>hours</i>, as in that of the <i>Ephemera</i>, and likewise
of the <i>PhalÃ¦nÃ¦ Attaci</i> L. &amp;c., which fall down dead
immediately after oviposition<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>. But if by any means it
be put off or prevented, their life may be protracted to
three or four times that period. Gleditsch asserts, that
by keeping apart the sexes of a grasshopper, their lives
were prolonged to eight or nine weeks, instead of two or
three, their ordinary length; and under similar circumstances
<i>EphemerÃ¦</i>, which usually perish in a day, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
been kept alive seven or eight. It is in consequence of
this very curious fact, which has not received from physiologists
the attention that it merits, that many butterflies
and other insects, which, when excluded from the
pupa in summer, perish in less than a month, live
through the winter, if excluded late in the autumn, and
the union of the sexes does not ensue. It is probable
that the great age to which Baker's <i>Blaps</i>, RÃ¶sel's <i>Cetonia</i>,
and Esper's <i>Dytiscus</i> attained, was owing to their
being virgins when taken, and subsequently kept from
any sexual intercourse. A parallel case happens in the
vegetable kingdom:&mdash;if annual plants are kept from seeding,
they will become biennial; as, likewise, if they are
sown too late in the year to produce seeds.</p>

<p>In the case, however, of the earlier or later exclusion
of the imago, another agent has probably some influence.
Buffon found that, other circumstances being alike,
the silkworm-moths placed in a <i>northern</i>, lived longer
than those exposed to a <i>southern</i> aspect: whence it appears
that the stimulus of heat shortens the lives of insects,
and consequently that cold tends to lengthen
them.</p>

<p>It must be observed too, that as the death of the female
insect does not take place until all the eggs are excluded,
the term of her life, though usually short in the
majority of species, which lay their whole number at
once, is proportionably long in those which, like the
queen-bee, have a longer period assigned them for this
important office. Huber affirms, that he had certain
proofs that she was engaged for two years in laying eggs,
all impregnated by a single sexual union<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
females of most insects that live in society, several months
are required to mature the last eggs that are in the
ovary. There is one tribe of insects, however, the females
of which are affirmed to survive this operation:
I mean <i>Dorthesia</i> Bosc; after which they even moult,
though not so often as before<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>.</p>

<p>I formerly related to you the singular fact, that the
drones in a beehive at a certain period are without mercy
slaughtered by the workers<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>. A fact the reverse of this
is recorded by Morier with respect to the locusts: he
affirms that the female, when she has done laying her
eggs, is surrounded and killed by the males. He says
that he never himself witnessed this extraordinary circumstance;
but that he heard it from such authority that
he gave full credit to it<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>. It is a fact, however, that
seems to require further evidence to entitle it to such credit.
These are instances in which, by a law of nature,
the life of these insects is shortened by violence. It does
not appear to have been ascertained how long those
drones live that, under particular circumstances, as stated
in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>, are exempted from the usual slaughter.</p>

<h3><i>EXTERNAL ANATOMY OF INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>TERMS, AND THEIR DEFINITION.</h5>


<p>Having shown you our little animals in every state,
and traced their progress from the egg to the perfect
insect, I must next give you some account of their <i>structure</i>
and <i>anatomy</i>. And under this head I shall introduce
you to a microcosm of wonders, in which the hand
of an <span class="smcap">Almighty</span> workman is singularly conspicuous.
One would at first think that the giant bulk of the elephant,
rhinoceros, or hippopotamus, must include a machine
far more complicated, a skeleton more multifarious
in its composition&mdash;covered by muscles infinitely more
numerous&mdash;instinct with a nervous system infinitely more
ramified&mdash;with a greater variety of organs and vascular
systems in play, than an animal that would scarcely counterpoise
a ten-millionth portion of it. Yet the reverse of
this is the fact; for the Creator, the more to illustrate
his wisdom, power, and skill, has decreed that the minute
animals whose history we are recording, shall be
much more complex in all the above respects than these
mighty monarchs of the forest and the flood. Of this
in the present and subsequent letters you will find repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and scarcely credible instances, which in every
rightly constituted mind are calculated to excite, in an
extraordinary degree, those sensations of reverence and
love for the <span class="smcap">Invisible Author</span> of these wonders, and
that faith and trust in his Power and Providence, which
an attentive survey of the works of Creation has a natural
tendency to produce. And you will not only be
struck by this circumstance, but equally by the infinite
variations in the structure that will present themselves to
your notice; and that not sudden and <i>per saltus</i>, but by
approaches made in the most gradual manner from one
form to another. And all along, where the uses of any
particular organ or part have been ascertained, if you
consider its structure with due attention, you will find in
it the nicest adaptation of means to an end: a circumstance
this, which proves most triumphantly, that the
<span class="smcap">Power</span> who immediately gave being to all the animal
forms, was neither a blind unconscious power, resulting
from a certain order of things, as some philosophists love
to speak<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>; nor a formative appetency in the animals
themselves, produced by their wants, habits, and local
circumstances, and giving birth, in the lapse of ages, to
all the animal forms that now people our globe<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>; but a
Power altogether distinct from and above nature, and its
<span class="smcap">Almighty Author</span><a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>I trust that what I have here advanced will excite your
attention to the subject I am now to enter upon; and I
flatter myself, that although at first sight it may promise
nothing more than a dry and tedious detail of parts and
organs, you will find it not without its peculiar interest
and attraction.</p>

<p>This department of the science&mdash;the Anatomy of Insects&mdash;may
still be regarded as in its infancy; and considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the almost insuperable difficulties which, from the
minuteness of the objects, oppose themselves to the skill
and instruments of the entomological anatomist, we can
scarcely hope that it will ever attain to that certainty and
perfection to which, as far as the larger animals are concerned,
anatomy has arrived. Yet infinitely more has
been accomplished than might have been expected, and
new accessions of light are daily thrown upon it. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
we consider what has been done by Malpighi, Leeuwenhoeck,
and especially Swammerdam, we admire the patience,
assiduity, and love of science, that enabled them, in
spite of what seemed insurmountable obstacles, to ascertain,
the first with respect to the silk-worm, and the latter
in numerous instances, the internal organization of these
minute creatures, as well as their external structure.
Reaumur, and his disciple De Geer, extending their researches,
have also contributed copiously to our knowledge
in this branch of our science.</p>

<p>But in this field no one has laboured so indefatigably
and with so much success as the celebrated Lyonnet; and
though his attention was confined to one object&mdash;the caterpillar
of the goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i> F.),&mdash;every
one who studies his immortal work must admire the
patient and skilful hand, the lyncean eye, and keen intellect,
that discovered, denuded, and traced every organ,
muscle, and fibre of that animal. Much is it to be regretted
that his proposed works on the pupa and imago
of the same insect, which, he informs us, were far advanced<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>,
were never finished and given to the world.
Our regret, however, is in some degree diminished by
the elaborate work of M. Herold on the butterfly of the
cabbage (<i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>), before eulogized<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>; in which
he has done much to supply this desideratum.</p>

<p>In more modern times, besides Herold, MM. Latreille,
Illiger, Marcelle de Serres, Savigny, Ramdohr, Treviranus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Sprengel, Audoin, Chabrier, and, above all, M.
Cuvier in his celebrated <i>Lectures on Comparative Anatomy</i>,
have considerably extended the boundaries of our
knowledge in this department: and much of what I have
to say to you in my letters on this subject, will be derived
from these respectable sources. In the exterior anatomy
of insects, I flatter myself that I shall be enabled to make
some material additions to the discoveries of my predecessors;
though few have occurred to me with respect to
their internal organization.</p>

<p>In treating of the anatomy of the <i>vertebrate animals</i>,
it is usual, I believe, to consider, first, the skeleton and
its integuments, whether of skin or muscle, and their
accessories; and afterwards the organs of the different
vital functions and of the senses. But in considering
the anatomy of <i>Insects</i>, the difference before stated<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>, observable
between them and the sub-kingdom just mentioned,
as to their structure, renders it advisable to divide
this subject into two parts&mdash;the first treating of their
<i>external</i> anatomy, and the second of their <i>internal</i>.&mdash;I
shall begin by drawing up for you a Table of the Nomenclature
of the parts of their <i>external</i> crust; its appendages
and processes<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>, external or internal, accompanied
by definitions of them; and followed by such observations
respecting them as the subject may seem to require
for its more full elucidation.</p>

<p>Anatomists have divided the human skeleton into <i>three</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
greater sections&mdash;the <i>Head</i>, the <i>Trunk</i>, and the <i>Limbs</i>.
That of insects, likewise, is resolvable into <i>three</i> primary
sections, but without including the limbs (which, as being
<i>appendages</i>, and therefore <i>secondary</i>, had best be
considered under the section of which they form a part),
for the <i>abdomen</i> in insects, as well as the rest of the body,
being covered with a <i>crust</i>, and forming a distinct part,
may be properly regarded as a <i>primary</i> section. And in
fact these three parts may be received as primary under
another view&mdash;the <i>head</i>, as containing the principal organs
of <i>sensation</i>; the <i>trunk</i>, as containing those of <i>motion</i>;
and the <i>abdomen</i>, as containing those of <i>generation</i><a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>.
Under each of these primary sections, I shall consider its
respective organs, members, and parts.</p>

<p>You are not to expect to find every part included in
the following Table in every insect; since it has been my
aim to introduce into it, the most remarkable of those
that are peculiar to particular tribes, genera, &amp;c. With
respect to these, I shall generally refer you to the individuals
in which they may be found.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XXXIV" id="LETTER_XXXIV">LETTER XXXIV.</a></h2>

<h3>EXTERNAL ANATOMY OF INSECTS.</h3>

<h5>THE HEAD, AND ITS PARTS.</h5>


<p>Before I confine my observations to the <i>head</i> of insects,
which I propose to consider separately in the present
letter, I must premise a few words upon their <i>body</i>
in general, or rather its <i>crust</i>, or external integument.
In this we may notice its <i>substance</i>, general <i>form</i>, <i>sculpture</i>,
<i>pubescence</i>, and <i>composition</i>.</p>


<p>i. I have already noticed the <i>substance</i> of this integument
in the preparatory states of insects<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>; I shall not,
therefore, here repeat what I then said, but restrict myself
chiefly to the consideration of it as it is found in their
<i>last</i> state, in which it is usually firmer than in their previous
stages of existence. In this respect, however, it
varies much in the different Orders, and even in the different
genera of the same Order. In some Coleopterous
insects, for instance, it is very hard, and difficult to perforate;
while in others it is soft, flexible, and a pin easily
passes through it<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a>. And in general, from a substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
in hardness resembling horn or shell, it passes through
the intermediate degrees of that of leather and parchment,
almost to a thin membrane. Yet in all cases there
is enough of rigidity and hardness to answer the principal
uses of a skeleton&mdash;to afford, namely, a sufficient
point of attachment for the muscles, and to support and
defend the interior organization; so that the play and
action of the vital and secretory systems may not be interrupted
or impeded.</p>

<p>With respect to the principles which enter into the
composition of this integument, very little seems to be
known at present; but few insects having been submitted
to a chemical analysis. The blister-beetle (<i>Cantharis
vesicatoria</i>), from its importance in medicine, has, however,
been more than once analysed; and though the
products have not been very precisely stated, yet we find
amongst them phosphate of lime, albumen, and some
other usual components of the substance of vertebrate
animals<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>. But which of these products belong to the
integument, and which to its contents, cannot be ascertained,
without a separate process for each; which would
not, I conceive, be very feasible. The substance, however,
of the integument of insects, though we know not
its precise contents, which probably vary in different genera,
&amp;c., appears not to be exactly of the nature of any
of those substances after which it has usually been denominated:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
it is not properly analogous either to real <i>horn</i>,
<i>shell</i>, <i>skin</i>, or <i>leather</i>, &amp;c. This seems to result from the
following circumstance:&mdash;Most of the excretions of vertebrate
animals, as horn, skin (at least when tanned),
feathers, wool, hair, &amp;c. when exposed to the action of
fire liquify, more or less, before they incinerate; emitting
at the same time a peculiar and disagreeable scent: but
upon applying this test to the parts of insects of the different
Orders, I found, in every instance, that incineration
took place without liquefaction, and was unaccompanied
by that peculiar scent which distinguishes the
others. Even the <i>claws</i>, which to the eye appear, as to
their substance, exactly like those of <i>Mammalia</i>, birds,
&amp;c. burn without melting, and retain their form after
red heat. That the insect integument is not <i>calcareous</i>
like that of the <i>Crustacea</i>, and the shells of <i>MolluscÃ¦</i>,
you may easily satisfy yourself, by immersing them in an
acid test. I made this experiment upon portions of insects
of several of the Orders, in an equal mixture of muriatic
acid and water, and the result was, not only that
all hexapods, but octopods, <i>Arachnida</i>, and even <i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i>,
upon immersion only emitted a few air-bubbles;
while, when the other myriapods, <i>Polydesmus</i>, <i>Iulus</i>,
<i>Glomeris</i>, &amp;c. and the <i>OniscidÃ¦</i>, were immersed, a
violent effervescence took place; proving the different
nature of their substance. It is remarkable that the two
great branches of the <i>Myriapods</i>, the <i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i> and
<i>IulidÃ¦</i> (<i>Chilopoda</i> and <i>Chilognatha</i> Latr.), should in
this respect be so differently circumstanced&mdash;the latter
having a calcareous integument, and the former not.&mdash;A
further difference distinguishes these two tribes: <i>old</i>
specimens of the <i>IulidÃ¦</i> usually lose their colour and turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
white, like <i>OniscidÃ¦</i>; while those of the <i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i>
retain it.</p>


<p>ii. The <i>form</i> of insects is so variable, that it can be
reduced to no other general rules&mdash;than that, for the
most part, the length exceeds the breadth, and the
breadth the depth, and that the upper surface is usually
convex. But to these rules there are numerous exceptions.
Thus many <i>TetyrÃ¦</i> F. (<i>Scutellera</i> Latr.), a kind
of bug, are as broad as they are long<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>; in the genus
<i>Gonyleptes</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> amongst the <i>Aptera</i>, and <i>Epeira cancriformis</i>,
a crab-shaped spider, the breadth exceeds the
length; in <i>Cynips</i>, and several other <i>Hymenoptera</i>, in
<i>Acrida</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> (<i>Locusta</i> F.), and other Orthopterous insects,
the depth exceeds the breadth; and in that singular
beetle, <i>Eurychora</i>; the cockroach (<i>Blatta</i>), &amp;c. the
upper surface is flat.</p>


<p>iii. The <i>sculpture</i> of the integument of insects is often
very remarkable; but as this will call for attention hereafter,
I shall only here observe in general, that ornament
and variety seem not to be the sole object of those elevations
and depressions which form so prominent a feature
of many of the animals in question; for by means of these,
many important purposes, that at first sight do not strike
the observer, may be served: such as giving firmness
to the crust in those places where it is most wanted; diminishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
its powers of resistance in others, so that it
may yield somewhat to the action of the muscles; increasing
or deducting from the weight of the body, so as
to produce a proper equipoise during its motions, whether
on the earth, in the air, or in the water. The depressions
of the outer surface of the crust, in many instances,
produce an elevation of it in the interior, and
so afford a useful point of attachment to certain muscles.
This observation seems more especially applicable to
those excavations that are common to particular tribes
or genera: thus the dorsal longitudinal channel to be
met with on the prothorax of most of the <i>Carabi</i> of LinnÃ©
on the inside of the crust have a corresponding ridge.
In <i>Locusta Dux</i>, also, (a Brazil locust,) the same part
has <i>four</i> transverse channels, corresponding with which
on the inside are as many <i>septa</i>, or ridges, to which muscles
are attached; and those larger impressed puncta
denominated <i>puncta ordinaria</i>, which distinguish the
same part in <i>Geotrupes</i> and many of the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>,
within are elevated, so as to form a kind of ginglymous
articulation with the base of the anterior coxÃ¦. The
other impressed puncta so often to be seen on the different
parts of various insects, which sometimes so intirely
cover the surface that scarcely any interval is discoverable
between them, though in many cases they appear to
be mere impressions that attenuate but do not perforate
the crust&mdash;yet in others, perhaps equally or more numerous,
they are real <i>pores</i>, which pass through the integument.
If, for instance, you take the thoracic shield
of the cockchafer (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>), and after removing
the muscle &amp;c., hold it against the light, with
the inner side towards the eye, you will see the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
through every puncture: or take the elytra of <i>Geotrupes
stercorarius</i>, or any common beetle in which these organs
have punctate striÃ¦, and examine them under a
lens on the inside, and you will see distinctly that the
punctures pass through the elytrum, and the membrane
that lines it<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a>. It is not improbable that in the case last
mentioned these pores may be of use, as the spiracles are
usually closely covered by the elytra, for the better transmission
of the air to those respiratory organs. Whether
the pores in the other parts of the body are for
transpiration, is more than I shall venture to affirm; but
as insects sometimes perspire, at least this has been ascertained
with respect to the hive-bee<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a>, this must be by the
means of some pores.</p>


<p>iv. The integument of insects is often clothed, either
partially or generally, with <i>pubescence</i>, or hairs of various
kinds&mdash;a circumstance which seems to have more
than one object. In <i>Parnus</i>, <i>Heterocerus</i>, <i>Gerris</i>, <i>Argyroneta
aquatica</i>, and some other aquatic insects, the end
in view seems to be to keep the water from wetting the
crust; and in this case the covering of hairs is dense,
silky, and decumbent. Another object is preventing
friction from being injurious: thus humble-bees, that
from their mode of nidification<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a>, are usually more particularly
exposed to it, are well clothed with hair; and
in those articulations of insects where much friction takes
place, we may often observe a dense fringe or coating of
the same substance. This you may see in the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
stag-beetle (<i>Lucanus Cervus</i>), where the thorax receives
the head; and very remarkably at the same point in the
Hercules-beetle (<i>Dynastes Hercules</i> MacLeay): but besides
these uses, there is probably one more universal,
which will apply as well to those thinly scattered bristles
and hairs, here and there one, to be noticed in many
insects: but concerning this I can only throw out a conjecture,
as I do not recollect ever to have seen any experiments
with regard to this use of animal hairs. But
may they not act as conductors, either to introduce
some invisible fluid into the body in a positive state, or
to convey it out, when received by other means, in a negative
state? Every one knows that the fur of a cat has
electric properties, and there may be an important general
use of this kind attached to the fur and hairs of animals<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a>.
But, as I said, I give this as a mere conjecture;
and only wish it may excite your attention to the subject,
and put in exercise your natural tact for experiment.</p>

<p>M. Cuvier regards the hairs of insects as merely a
continuation of the epidermis, with which they fall when
the animal changes its skin<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a>; but this will apply only to
the hairs of larvÃ¦: for the hairs of perfect insects in
many cases are implanted in a pore, and pass through
epidermis or crust to the membrane that lines it, in which
they terminate.</p>


<p>v. We are now to consider the <i>composition</i> of the integument;
under which term I would include the different
layers of which it consists, and its articulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>1. With respect to the <i>first</i> of these circumstances, the
<i>layers</i> of which the integument consists, it seems to exhibit
some, although not an exact, analogy with the <i>skin</i>,
rather than the <i>skeleton</i>, of the vertebrate animals<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a>. In
these last, the skin is stated to consist of <i>four</i> layers.
Of these the exterior one is the <i>epidermis</i>, or scarf-skin:
under this is the <i>rete mucosum</i>, or mucous tissue, which
gives its colour to the skin; next follows the <i>papillary
tissue</i> formed by the extremities of the nerves, and in
which the sense of <i>touch</i> principally resides; the last and
innermost layer is the <i>skin proper</i>, or leather, called <i>Dermis</i>,
<i>Derma</i>, or <i>Corium</i><a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>. <i>Two</i> of these layers M. Cuvier
assigns to insects. They have, he observes, in every
state, a true <i>epidermis</i><a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a>; and in their state of larva he
finds that the infinite variety of colours that so adorn
many of them is produced by a mucous substance observable
between the epidermis and the muscles<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a>: this
seems analogous to the <i>rete mucosum</i>. To this, dried
and mixed with their horny substance, he attributes also
the colours of the perfect insect: "for," says he, "when
the <i>Lepidoptera</i> are in the chrysalis, the little coloured
scales which are to ornament their wings, are then in a
state of mucosity similar to that which is found under the
skin of the caterpillar. The colours of the <i>Arachnida</i>,"
he goes on, "are also due to this mucosity: it is discoverable
under the skin, and has the appearance of minute
glandular points of which the shades vary considerably.
But in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, and many other Orders, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
colours of the skin are mixed in its horny tissue, nearly as
those of the <i>Testacea</i> are in their calcareous shells"<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a>. In
the perfect insects, therefore, in most cases, we may consider
the <i>epidermis</i> and <i>rete mucosum</i> as together forming
the exterior and coloured integument of insects&mdash;that
part which in the table, since it is not properly an
<i>epidermis</i>, I have distinguished by the name of <i>Exoderma</i>.</p>

<p>The learned author just quoted has observed nothing
under the skin of white-blooded animals that he regards as
analogous to <i>nervous papillÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>. In some parts of insects,
as in the lamellÃ¦ of the antennÃ¦ of the <i>Petalocera</i>, and the
extremities of the joints, especially the last, of many palpi,
there is however an appearance of them; and it seems
reasonable to suppose that where the sense of <i>touch</i> resides,
there must, even in insects, be something of a <i>papillary
tissue</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to the innermost integument of the vertebrate
animals,&mdash;the <i>leather</i>, or real skin,&mdash;this learned
comparative anatomist finds nothing analogous to it in
the integuments of insects<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a>; but as he does not notice it,
he appears to have overlooked the substance that lines
the outer crust, or <i>exoderma</i>, in the <i>Coleoptera</i> and most
other orders. This is not always easily detected; but it
may generally be discovered by breaking, or rather tearing
(not cutting), after having cleared away the muscles,
any part of the body of an insect. It is always very visible
on the under side of <i>elytra</i><a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a>, but is not discoverable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
in <i>tegmina</i>. It appears to consist, in many cases, of several
layers of a whitish membrane, and generally breaks
into fibres. In some elytra of the larger <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>,
towards the sides the exterior layer is separated from the
rest by a kind of cellular substance. The fibrous structure
of this inner skin (which I call the <i>Esoderma</i>) seems
to give it some affinity to the skin of vertebrate animals<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>.
In many parts of the body, however, it appears to be
merely a thin pellicle. A medical friend, to whom I
showed specimens of it, thinks it a kind of cellular membrane.</p>

<p>2. A few words are next necessary with regard to the
<i>articulation</i> of the integument, or the mode by which the
several pieces of which it and its members consist, are
united to each other. In some, as in several of the parts
of the head, the occiput, vertex, temples, cheeks, &amp;c.&mdash;the
line of distinction is merely imaginary; in others an
impressed line separates a part from its neighbours, as is
the case with the <i>nose</i> in <i>Vespa</i>, &amp;c. the head in the
<i>Arachnida</i>. But in the majority of instances the parts
are separated by a suture, or form a real joint. The
kinds of articulation observed by anatomists in vertebrate
animals do not all occur in insects, and they seem to
have some peculiar to themselves. Thus, for instance,
they have no proper <i>suture</i>; for though they exhibit the
appearance both of the <i>harmonic</i> and <i>squamose</i> (<i>ecailleuse</i>
Cuv.) sutures<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>, yet these parts being all limited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
the <i>esoderma</i>, or skin, above noticed as lining the integument,
and all admitting a degree of motion more or
less intense, rather afford examples, as the case may be,
of other kinds of articulation<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a>. Again, they have no
proper <i>Enarthrosis</i>, or ball and socket; though the anterior
coxÃ¦ of the Capricorn-beetles (<i>Cerambyx</i> L.) approach
very near to this kind of articulation, as will be
shown more fully in another place. The inosculating
segments or rings, which distinguish the abdomen, and
sometimes other parts of insects, are an example of a
kind of articulation not to be met with in the <i>Vertebrata</i>.
The ginglymous articulation, in which the prominences
of the ends of two joints are mutually received by their
cavities, and which admits only of flexion and extension,
often prevails in the limbs, &amp;c. of insects; but in many
cases the joints are merely suspended to each other by a
ligament or membrane; and, in fact, the integument of
insects, with regard to its articulation, even where the
joints ginglymate, may be said in general to consist of
pieces connected by the internal ligament, membrane, or
skin that lines it; for even in the legs, where the ginglymous
articulation is sometimes very remarkable and
complex, as will be shown to you hereafter, the joints
are also connected by this substance, as you may see if
you examine the legs of any Coleopterous insect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>number</i> of articulations or pieces that form the
integument and its members in these animals, varies
greatly in different tribes, genera, &amp;c. Thus, in the common
louse (<i>Pediculus humanus</i>) they scarcely reach fifty,
while in some cockroaches (<i>Blatta</i>) they amount to more
than eight times that number.</p>

<p>Having premised these observations on the external
anatomy of the body in general, in the remainder of the
present letter I shall confine myself to the consideration
of the <i>head</i> and its <i>parts</i>.</p>


<p>I. The <i>Head</i> of insects, as the principal seat of the
organs of sensation, must be regarded in them, as well
as in the vertebrate animals, as the <i>governing</i> part of the
body. It may be considered with respect to its <i>substance</i>,
<i>figure</i>, <i>composition</i>, <i>superficies</i>, <i>proportion</i>, <i>direction</i>,
<i>articulation</i> with the <i>trunk</i>, <i>motions</i>&mdash;and more particularly
as to its <i>parts</i> and <i>appendages</i>.</p>


<p>i. With regard to its <i>substance</i>&mdash;the head may be said
in general to be the <i>hardest</i> part of the crust: and it is
so for very good reasons. In the first place, as it has to
make way for the rest of the body when the animal moves,
it is thereby best fitted to overcome such resistance as
may be opposed by the medium through which it has to
pass; in the next, as it bears the organs of manducation,
it was requisite that it should be sufficiently firm and solid
to support their action, which is often upon very hard
substances; and besides this, as no motion of its parts
<i>inter se</i>, as in the case of the trunk, is requisite to facilitate
the play of its organs, a thin integument was
not wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>


<p>ii. The most general law relative to the <i>figure</i> or shape
of the head seems to be, that it should approach to that of
an equilateral triangle, with its angles rounded, and the
vertex being the mouth; and that the vertical diameter
should be less than the horizontal, whether longitudinal
or transverse. But the infractions of this law are numerous
and various. Thus, in some insects an isosceles triangle
is represented by the head, the length being greater
than the breadth; in others, instead of being flat it is
compressed, so that the horizontal diameter is less than
the vertical; in others, again, it is orbicular, or round and
depressed; in others nearly spherical: occasionally it is
rather cylindrical. In many instances it is very long;
in others the width exceeds the length. Though often
narrowest before, in some cases the reverse takes place.
Its anterior end is often attenuated into a long or short
snout or rostrum, and its posterior into a long or short
neck. Its contour, though usually regular, is sometimes
either cut into lobes, or scooped out into sinuosities.
But to enumerate minutely all the variations of form
which take place in the head of insects would be endless;
I shall therefore proceed to the next particular.</p>


<p>iii. The <i>composition</i> of the head is very simple; for,
exclusive of its organs, it consists only of a single piece
or box, without suture or segment, with an aperture at
the end below to receive the instruments of manducation,
others for the eyes and stemmata when present, and also
for the antennÃ¦. In the <i>Arachnida</i>, &amp;c., in which the
head is not separated from the thorax, it is merely a
plate, the under-side or cavity of which is occupied and
filled by the above instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p>


<p>iv. With regard to its <i>superficies</i>, the head of insects
is generally more or less uneven, though in some cases it
presents no inequalities. In many of the Lamellicorn
tribes, and a few other individuals, in one sex at least,
as has been before observed<a name="FNanchor_1173_1173" id="FNanchor_1173_1173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a>, it is armed with long
horns, or prominent tubercles; it is often covered with
numerous puncta, or pores; and some of its parts, as the
nose, after-nose, &amp;c. in particular groups, marked out
by an impressed line<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>. In many <i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>,
&amp;c. its upper surface is convex, and the lower concave;
in others both surfaces are convex.</p>


<p>v. It is the most general rule, as to its <i>proportion</i>, that
it shall be smaller than either trunk or abdomen; but in
some instances, as in the S. American ant, <i>Atta megacephala</i>,
it is much larger than either.</p>


<p>vi. By the <i>direction</i> of the head, I mean its inclination
with respect to the prothorax. The most natural
direction, or that which obtains most generally, is for it
to form an angle more or less obtuse with the part just
mentioned. This seems to obtain particularly in <i>Coleoptera</i>;
but in some, as <i>Mylabris</i>, it is inflexed, forming
an acute angle with it. In the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>
(<i>Cimex</i> L. &amp;c.) it is generally in the same line with the
body, or horizontal; and in many <i>Diptera</i> it is vertical.</p>


<p>vii. We now come to a circumstance which will detain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
us longer, namely, its <i>articulation with the trunk</i>,
or rather with its anterior segment, the <i>prothorax</i>.&mdash;M.
Cuvier makes <i>two</i> principal kinds of articulation of
the head upon the prothorax, in one of which the points
of contact are solid, and the movement subordinate to
the configuration of the parts; in the other, the articulation
is ligamentous, the head and the thorax being united
and kept together by membranes.</p>

<p>1. The <i>first</i> of these kinds of articulation&mdash;that by the
contact of solid parts&mdash;takes place, he says, in <i>four</i> different
ways. "In the most common conformation, in
the part that corresponds to the neck, the head bears
one or two smooth tubercles, which receive corresponding
cavities of the anterior part of the prothorax observable
in the Lamellicorn and Capricorn beetles. In this
case the head can move backwards, and the mouth forwards
and downwards. The <i>second</i> mode of solid articulation
takes place when the posterior part of the head
is rounded, and turns upon its axis in a corresponding
cavity of the anterior part of the prothorax; as may be
seen in <i>Curculio</i>, <i>Reduvius</i>, &amp;c. The axis of motion is
then at the centre of articulation, and the mouth of the
insect moves equally backwards and forwards, upwards
and downwards, to right and left.&mdash;The <i>third</i> sort of articulation,
by solid surfaces, takes place when the head,
truncated posteriorly, and presenting a flat surface, is
articulated, sometimes upon a tubercle of the thorax,
and sometimes upon another flat and corresponding surface,
as in almost all the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and the majority
of the <i>Diptera</i>. The disposition of the <i>fourth</i> kind of
articulation allows the head only the movement of the
angular hinge (<i>le seul mouvement de charniÃ¨re angulaire</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
The only examples at present known are in some species
of <i>Attelabus</i> F. The head of these insects terminates
behind in a round tubercle, received in a corresponding
cavity of the thorax: the lower margin of this cavity has
a notch, and permits the movement of the head only in
one direction<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>."</p>

<p>2. The <i>second</i> kind of articulation, the ligamentous,
he affirms takes place only in <i>orthopterous</i> and some
<i>neuropterous</i> insects: "The head in this kind of articulation
is only impeded in its movements towards the back,
because it is stopped there by the advance of the prothorax;
but below it is quite free. The membranes or
ligaments extend from the circuit of the occipital cavity
to that of the anterior part of the prothorax, which gives
a great extent to the movement<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a>."</p>

<p>When I consider the well-deserved celebrity of the
great author whose words I have here quoted, and the
great and useful light that the genius and learning which
conducted his patient labours and researches have thrown
over every department of comparative anatomy,&mdash;a science
he may be almost said to have founded,&mdash;I feel the
most intire reluctance to differ in any thing from an authority
so justly venerable to all lovers of that interesting
study. But, however great my diffidence and hesitation
to express an opinion at all opposed to his, the interests
of truth and science require that I should state those
particulars in which my own observations, made upon a
careful examination of various insects of every Order,
have led to results in some respects different from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
above. "<i>Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus</i>;" and
if the Genius of Comparative Anatomy ever nodded, it
sometimes happened when he was examining the structure
of insects. An instance of this with regard to the
mouth of the bee has been noticed by Mr. Savigny<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a>;
and indeed it is not wonderful that in so extensive an
undertaking, in which the number of examples to be examined
upon every branch of his subject must be immense,
that he did not always scrutinize minutely those
that seemed less important. Every writer on every department
of Natural History, especially where the objects
of research, as in the insect world, are so infinite in
number, will be liable to such mistakes; but these will
meet with due allowance from every candid mind&mdash;</p>

<p>and I shall express my trust that you will overlook any
errors of mine; and doubtless I shall not be free from
them&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The two kinds of articulation of the head which our
learned author has stated as the principal ones, will, I
think, be found upon examination not so widely distant
as his expressions seem to indicate; for in fact in all insects,
as well as the <i>Orthoptera</i>, this part is <i>suspended</i> by
a membrane or ligament which unites the margins of the
occipital cavity with those of the anterior one of the prothorax:
thus forming all round some protection to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
organs that are transmitted from the head through the
latter part to the rest of the body. Though the head in
most <i>Orthoptera</i> is not partly received into the cavity
of the prothorax, as is the case in the Order <i>Coleoptera</i>,
but is rather suspended to it, yet in some instances, for
example in the mole-cricket (<i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>), it is
partially inserted.</p>

<p>Again: when, in his <i>first</i> mode of articulation by contact
of solid parts, he speaks of one or two smooth tubercles
of the neck, with their corresponding cavities in
the prothorax, as forming the most common conformation,
you would expect to find examples of this in very
many insects; yet upon a close examination, unless in
<i>Oryctes nasicornis</i><a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>, and perhaps in others of the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>
MacLeay, you would scarcely meet with any
thing that could be called a tubercle and its corresponding
cavity in the neck or prothorax of any Lamellicorn
or Capricorn beetle that you might chance to examine.
You would find, indeed, that the occiput was usually
smooth and very slippery, as if lubricated; that in its
margin were one or two notches (<i>Myoglyphides</i>), with
muscles attached to them; that in the former of these
tribes, the <i>Lamellicorns</i>, it projected on each side so as to
form a more or less prominent angle; and that the throat
(<i>jugulum</i>) was very convex, and lodged in a cavity of the
lower margin of the prothorax: but further appearances
of tubercles &amp;c. you would in vain look for even in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
tribe; and in the <i>Capricorns</i> you would find that the general
conformation in this respect belonged to our learned
author's <i>second</i> mode of solid articulation, resembling
that of the majority of the weevils (<i>Curculio</i> L.), in which
the head has no projecting angles or tubercles, or other
elevation, but is received usually into the circular cavity
of the prothorax.</p>

<p>His <i>third</i> mode of this articulation, that of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i>, is so peculiar, that it ought to be considered
as a <i>primary</i> kind; since in this the head moves
<i>upon</i> the prothorax as upon a pivot, and has a kind of
versatile motion.</p>

<p>With regard to his <i>fourth</i> mode, which from his description
appears to be that of <i>Apoderus</i> Oliv., he allows
motion to the head only in <i>one</i> direction, observing that
the lower margin of the prothoracic cavity has a notch.
But M. Latreille calls the articulation of the head in this
genus an <i>Enarthrosis</i><a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a>, which admits motion in every direction;
and if you examine the common species (<i>A. Coryli</i>),
you will find that the prothorax has a sinus taken
out of its upper margin, as well as out of its lower one&mdash;which
at any rate will allow a motion <i>upwards</i>.</p>

<p>I merely mention these little inaccuracies, with due
diffidence, as some apology for giving you a different and
at least a more popular and general view of this part of
my subject, which I shall now proceed to state to you.
It seems to me most convenient for the Entomologist, and
most consonant to nature, to divide insects, with respect
to the articulation of the head with the trunk, into three
<i>primary</i> sections, each admitting one or more subdivisions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>
<p>1. The <i>first</i> consists of those whose head inosculates
more or less in the anterior cavity of the chest; and
whose articulation, therefore, seems to partake in a greater
or less degree of the ball and socket (<i>Enarthrosis</i>). The
head, however, is often capable of being protruded from
this cavity. If you take into your hand any common <i>Harpalus</i>
that you may find under a stone, you will see, if
pressed, that it can shoot forth its head, so as to be entirely
disengaged from the prothorax: a neck of ligament
intervening between them<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>: of course this power of protruding
the head enables the animal to disengage it at its
will from the restriction imposed upon its motions by the
surrounding margin of the prothoracic cavity. To this
section belong all the <i>Coleoptera</i>, the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>
(<i>Cimex</i> L., &amp;c.), and some of the <i>Neuroptera</i> (<i>Raphidia</i>,
<i>Semblis</i>, &amp;c.).&mdash;It may be further divided into <i>two</i>
subsections&mdash;those, namely, whose head inosculates in
the prothorax by means of a <i>neck</i>: as for instance Latreille's
<i>Trachelides</i>, <i>Apoderus</i>, and the <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>,
amongst the beetles; the <i>ReduviadÃ¦</i> amongst the <i>Heteropterous</i>
insects, and <i>Raphidia</i> in the <i>Neuroptera</i>; and
those whose head inosculates in the prothorax without
the intervention of a neck; as, the <i>Petalocera</i>, the aquatic
beetles (<i>Dytiscus</i>, <i>Hydrophilus</i>, &amp;c.), and most of the
genus <i>Curculio</i> L. in the first of these orders, the great
body of the <i>CimicidÃ¦</i> in the second, and <i>Semblis</i>, <i>Corydalis</i>,
&amp;c. in the third.</p>

<p>2. The <i>second</i> section consists of those insects whose
head does not inosculate in the chest, but is merely suspended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
to it by ligament or membrane. To this belong
most of the tribes of the <i>Orthoptera</i> Order, with the exception
of the <i>MantidÃ¦</i>, the <i>Dermaptera</i>, the <i>Homopterous
Hemiptera</i>, and such of the <i>Aptera</i> as have the
head distinct from the prothorax.&mdash;This section admits
of a <i>triple</i> subdivision: those, namely, whose head is
<i>wholly</i> covered by the shield of the prothorax, as in
<i>Blatta</i> L.; those whose head is <i>partly</i> covered by it, as
<i>Gryllotalpa</i>, and other <i>Gryllina</i>; and those whose head
is quite free, not being at all impeded in its motion by
the prothorax, as the <i>Dermaptera</i>, <i>Nirmus</i>, <i>Pediculus</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>3. The <i>third</i> section consists of those whose head is
truncated posteriorly, and flat or concave, with a very
small occipital aperture, and is attached to a neck of the
prothorax upon which it turns, or is merely suspended
to that part. This includes the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
<i>Diptera</i>, the <i>Libellulina</i>, &amp;c. in the <i>Neuroptera</i>,
and the <i>MantidÃ¦</i> in the <i>Orthoptera</i>. <i>Three</i> subsections
at least, if not more, present themselves in this section:
the first is, of those whose head is united to the prothorax,
without the latter forming any <i>neck</i>. To this belong
the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Trichoptera</i>? The <i>second</i> is of those
the upper side of whose thoracic neck is <i>ligamentous</i>;
and here you may range most of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>. The
<i>third</i> is of those in whom it is a <i>continuation</i> of the ordinary
<i>integument</i>. In this subsection the <i>Diptera</i>, <i>Libellulina</i>
and <i>MantidÃ¦</i> will find their place. In this last
section the head appears to turn upon the thorax as upon
a pivot.</p>

<p>Before I finish what I have to say on the <i>articulation</i>
of the head, I must direct your attention to the <i>analogies</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
that hold in this respect between the different tribes.
Thus the <i>Coleoptera</i> are analogous to the <i>Heteropterous
Hemiptera</i>; the <i>Orthoptera</i>, with the exception of the
<i>MantidÃ¦</i>, to the <i>Homopterous Hemiptera</i>; the <i>MantidÃ¦</i>
to the <i>Libellulina</i>; the <i>Lepidoptera</i> to the <i>Trichoptera</i>;
the <i>Hymenoptera</i> to the <i>Diptera</i>, with a slight variation,
and probably others might be traced.</p>


<p>viii. A word or two upon the <i>motions</i> of which the
head of insects is capable. M. Cuvier, in the extracts
lately laid before you, speaks of different powers of movement
as the result of different configurations of the parts
of the head. This probably is correct with regard to
many cases; but a great deal will depend upon the power
the insect has of protruding its head and disengaging
its base from the restriction of the prothorax; for where,
like the <i>Harpali</i>, <i>Staphylini</i>, &amp;c. it is able to do this, it
can probably move its head in every direction. It is
only where the ligaments are less elastic, or allow of little
tension, that its movements are confined; and few
living insects have been sufficiently examined to ascertain
how far this takes place. In those cases belonging
to the <i>third</i> section of articulations, in which the head
moves <i>upon</i> the thorax as upon a pivot, as is the case
with <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>, the movement is nearly
versatile. I have seen a fly turn its head completely
round, so that the mouth became supine and the vertex
prone; and from the form and fixing of the head, it
should seem that those of the <i>MantidÃ¦</i> were endued
with the same faculty.</p>


<p>ix. The <i>parts</i> and <i>appendages</i> of the head are now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
the last place to be considered. I shall begin with the
<i>Mouth</i>, or rather the orifice in which the <i>trophi</i> or organs
of manducation are inserted. In some insects, as was before
observed, they occupy all the under-side of the head,
as in the <i>Arachnida</i>, <i>Myriapoda</i>, &amp;c; but in the great
majority they fill an orifice in its anterior part, which in
some instances, as in <i>Lampyris</i>, the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Cimex</i>
L., <i>Truxalis</i>, appears to be nearly under the head;
but in general it terminates that part, though it extends
further below than above. In <i>Chermes</i>, a Homopterous
genus, the promuscis is stated to be in the <i>Antepectus</i>, and
consequently the <i>mouth</i>; but, as I shall endeavour to prove
to you hereafter, this is a fallacy. In the males of the
species of <i>Coccus</i> there is no mouth at all. In that of the
elm (<i>C. Ulmi</i>) in lieu there are ten little shining points,
arranged two before and two behind in a line, and three
on each side in a triangle<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>. It is to be observed that the
orifice of which I am speaking is usually much smaller
in those insects which take their food by suction, the
<i>Hemiptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c., than in the masticating
tribes. With regard to the real mouth, or that
through which the food enters, I have nothing at present
to observe, except that it lies between the upper-lip and
tongue, is sometimes covered by a valve, as in <i>Apis</i>,
<i>Vespa</i><a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a>, &amp;c., and is different in the masticators and
suckers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I shall next offer a few observations <i>seriatim</i>, as they
stand in the Table, upon the organs of manducation;
which, to avoid circumlocution, instead of <i>Instrumenta</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
<i>cibaria</i>, the name Fabricius gave them, I shall call <i>trophi</i>
or <i>feeders</i>. It is upon these parts, you are aware, that
the system of the celebrated Entomologist just mentioned
is founded; and could they always, or even for the most
part, be inspected with ease, they would no doubt afford
characters as various and discriminative as those of the
vertebrate animals. Differences in these parts indicate
a difference in the mode in which the animal takes its
food, and often in the kind of food, and sometimes in its
general economy and habits,&mdash;circumstances which are
powerful and weighty in supporting the claim of any set
of animals to be considered as forming a natural genus
or group. Trifling variations, however, of these parts,
unless supported by other characters and qualities, ought
not to have much stress laid upon them, since, if we insist
upon these, in some tribes almost every species might
be made a genus.</p>

<p>With respect to their <i>trophi</i> in general, insects of late
have been divided into two great tribes<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a>, <i>masticators</i> and
<i>suckers</i>; the <i>first</i> including those that are furnished with
instruments to separate and <i>masticate</i> their food; namely,
an upper- and under-lip (<i>labrum</i> and <i>labium</i>), upper- and
under-jaws (<i>mandibulÃ¦</i> and <i>maxillÃ¦</i>), labial and maxillary
palpi, and a tongue (<i>lingua</i>): and the <i>second</i> those
in which these parts are replaced by an articulate or exarticulate
machine, consisting of several parts and pieces
analogous to the above, which pierce the food of the animal,
and form a tube by which it <i>sucks</i> its juices. If,
however, the mode in which insects take their food be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
strictly considered, it will be found that in this view they
ought rather to be regarded as forming <i>three</i> tribes; for
the great majority of the <i>Hymenoptera</i> order, and perhaps
some others, though furnished with mandibles and
maxillÃ¦, never use them for mastication, but really lap
their food with their tongue: these, therefore, might be
denominated <i>lappers</i>.</p>

<p>When a mouth is furnished with the <i>seven</i> ordinary
organs used in taking the food and preparing it for deglutition&mdash;I
mean the upper-lip and the two upper-jaws;
the under-lip and the two under-jaws, including the labial
and maxillary palpi; and the tongue&mdash;I denominate
it a <i>perfect mouth</i>; but when it is deficient in any of these
organs, or they exist merely as rudiments, or when their
place is supplied by others, (which, though they may be
analogous parts, have little or no connection with them
in their use or structure,) I denominate it an <i>imperfect
mouth</i>. This last I would further distinguish, according
to the nature of its <i>trophi</i>, by other and more distinctive
terms, as I shall presently explain to you.</p>

<p>1. <i>Labrum</i><a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a>.&mdash;I shall first consider the organs present
in a <i>perfect mouth</i>, beginning with the <i>upper-lip</i> (<i>labrum</i>).
This part, which Fabricius sometimes confounded
with the <i>nose</i>, miscalling it <i>clypeus</i>, is usually a moveable<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>
piece, attached by its base to the anterior margin
of the part last named, and covering the mouth, and
sometimes the mandibles, from above. In insects in
their last state it is usually of a horny or shelly <i>substance</i>;
yet in some cases, as in <i>Copris</i> and <i>Cetonia</i>, beetles that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
imbibe juices, it is membranous. In <i>form</i> and shape it
varies greatly, being sometimes nearly square, at others
almost round; in some insects representing a parallelogram,
in others a triangle, and in many it is oblong. In
some instances it is long and narrow, but more generally
short and wide. It is often large, but occasionally very
minute. In the majority it has an intire <i>margin</i>, but it is
not seldom emarginate or bilobed, or even dentate. Its
<i>surface</i> is commonly even, but it is sometimes uneven,
sometimes flat, at others convex, and in a few species
armed with a short horn or tubercle<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a>. As to its <i>pubescence</i>,
it is often naked, but now and then fringed or clothed
with down or hairs, or sprinkled with bristles. It consists
in almost every instance of a single piece; but an
exception to this occurs in <i>Halictus</i>, a little bee, in the
females of which it is furnished with a slender appendage<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>.&mdash;The
<i>direction</i> of the upper-lip is various. It is
rarely horizontal, or in the same line with the nose, often
vertical; it sometimes forms an obtuse angle with the
anterior part of the head, and occasionally an acute one,
when it is more or less inflexed. The <i>use</i> of this part is
ordinarily to close the mouth from above, to assist in retaining
the food while undergoing the process of mastication;
but in many Hymenopterous insects its principal
use seems to be, to keep the <i>trophi</i> properly folded; and
in some cases where it is inflexed, as in the leaf-cutter
bees (<i>Megachile</i> Latr.), to defend its base, while the mandibles
are employed, from injury by their action<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Labium</i><a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a>.&mdash;On the under-side of the head, and opposed
to the upper-lip, the mouth is closed by another
moveable organ, concerning the nomenclature and analogies
of which Entomologists have differed considerably.
At the first view of it, this organ seems a very complex
machine, since the under-jaws or <i>maxillÃ¦</i> are attached
to it on each side, and the tongue is often seen to
emerge from it above, so as to appear merely a part of it;
but as the former answer to the upper-jaws, and the latter
is the analogue of the part bearing the same name in
the vertebrate animals, I shall consider these as distinct
and <i>primary</i> organs, and treat of the under-lip (<i>labium</i>)
of which I am now speaking, by itself. LinnÃ© takes no
notice of this part, but his illustrious compatriot and cotemporary,
De Geer, did not so overlook it: he appears
to consider the whole apparatus, including the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>,
as the <i>labium</i><a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a>; but sometimes he distinguishes the middle
piece by that name<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a>; and the tongue, in the case of
the stag-beetle, he denominates a proboscis (<i>trompe</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a>.
In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> he calls this part <i>tongue</i>, <i>under-lip</i>,
and <i>proboscis</i>: but seems to prefer the last term<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a>. Fabricius
originally regarded the whole middle piece as a
<i>labium</i><a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>; but afterwards (though his definition is not accurate,
since he assigns the <i>palpi</i> to the <i>ligula</i>, which he
affirms is covered by the <i>labium</i>&mdash;circumstances by no
means universal in <i>Coleoptera</i>) he considers this as consisting
of <i>ligula</i> and <i>labium</i><a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a>. Latreille at first regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
the <i>ligula</i> of Fabricius as the <i>labium</i>, and called the <i>labium</i>
of that author the <i>mentum</i><a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a>; but afterwards he gave
the name of <i>labium</i> to the whole middle piece of the
lower apparatus of the mouth&mdash;calling the upper piece,
with Fabricius, the <i>ligula</i>, and retaining the denomination
of <i>mentum</i> for the lower<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a>.</p>

<p>If the circumstances of the case are duly considered,
I think you will be convinced that the term under-lip,
or <i>labium</i>, should be confined to that part which the
learned Dane so named. For I would ask, Which is
the part on the under side of the head that is the antagonist,
if I may so speak, of the upper-lip or <i>labrum</i>?
Is it not that organ which, when the mouth is closed,
meets that part, and in conjunction with it shuts all in?
Now in numerous insects, particularly the Lamellicorn
beetles (<i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> and <i>Lucanus</i> L.), this is precisely the
case. In the Predaceous beetles, indeed, (<i>Cicindela</i>, <i>Carabus</i>,
<i>Dytiscus</i> L. &amp;c.) the under-lip does not meet the
upper, to close the mouth and shut in the tongue; neither
can the tongue be said so to do, but only, from some
circumstances connected with its manner of taking its
food, it is requisite that the last-mentioned organ should
not be retractile or covered; but its miscalled <i>mentum</i>
is still the analogue of that part which helps to close the
mouth in the former tribe. Should not this, therefore,
which so often performs the <i>office</i>, be distinguished by the
<i>name</i>, of a lip? Again, is it not rather incongruous to
consider that organ which confessedly more or less performs
the office of a <i>tongue</i>, as a part of the <i>lip</i>? Though
it often wears that appearance, yet I believe, if the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
is thoroughly and patiently investigated, it will be
found that on their upper side its roots are attached to the
interior of the upper side of the head, as well as on their
lower side to the <i>labium</i>; so that it may be regarded as
common to the two lips, and therefore not properly considered
as an appendage of the under-lip alone.</p>

<p>Having assigned my reasons for preferring the name
given to the part in question by Fabricius, rather than
that of Latreille, I shall next make my observations on
the part itself. In many cases the <i>labium</i>, or the middle
piece of the lower oral apparatus, appears to consist of
<i>two</i> joints: this you may see in the great water-beetle
(<i>Hydrophilus piceus</i>), the burying-beetles (<i>Necrophorus</i>),
the Orthopterous tribes<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>, the <i>Hymenoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a>, and others.
In this case the upper or terminal piece is to be regarded
as the <i>labium</i>, and the lower or basal one (which Mr.
MacLeay calls the <i>stipes</i>) as the <i>mentum</i> or chin&mdash;at
other times, as in some Lamellicorn beetles, the only separation
is a transverse elevated line, or an obtuse angle
formed by the meeting of the two parts, and very frequently
there is no separation at all, in which case the
whole piece, the <i>mentum</i> merging in it, may be denominated
the <i>labium</i>.</p>

<p>With respect to its <i>substance</i>, the <i>labium</i> in most Coleopterous
insects is hard and horny, in <i>Necrophorus</i> it
is membranous, and the <i>mentum</i> harder; in <i>Prionus
coriarius</i>, our largest Capricorn-beetle, both are membranous;
in the bee-tribes, <i>Apis</i> L., the <i>labium</i> rather
resembles leather, while the <i>mentum</i> is hard. Its <i>surface</i>
is often convex, sometimes plane, and sometimes even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
concave; as for instance in <i>Melolontha Fullo</i>, a rare
chafer occasionally found on the coast of Kent. In some
it is covered with excavated points; in others it is quite
smooth. In numbers, as in the Predaceous beetles, both
<i>labium</i> and <i>mentum</i> are perfectly naked; in others, as in
the common cockchafer, they are hairy; in <i>Geniates barbatus</i>
Kirby, another chafer in the male insect, the <i>labium</i>
is naked, while the <i>mentum</i>, which forms a piece
distinct from that part, is covered with a dense rigid
beard<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a>. In <i>shape</i> the whole <i>labium</i> varies considerably,
much more than the <i>labrum</i>; for in addition to most of
the forms I enumerated when I described that organ,
which I shall not here repeat, you may meet with examples
of many others. Thus, to instance in the Petalocerous
tribes (<i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> L.), in some, as in the <i>RutelidÃ¦</i>, the
<i>labium</i> is urceolate, or representing in some degree the
shape of a pitcher<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a>; in others it is deeply concave, and
not a little resembles a basin or a bowl<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a>; this form is
peculiar to the <i>labium</i> of <i>Cremastocheilus</i> Knoch, a scarce
North American beetle; in another related to this, but
of an African type (<i>Genuchus</i> Kirby MS. <i>Cetonia cruenta</i>
F.), it is a trapezoid plate, which is elevated from
the head, and hangs over the throat like a chin<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>. In the
<i>Hymenoptera</i> it is extremely narrow and long, and embraces
the sides of the tongue, as well as covering it from
below; so that it wears the appearance of a kind of tube<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>.
Generally speaking, the length of the <i>labium</i> exceeds its
breadth; but in the Predaceous beetles the reverse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
this takes place, it being very short and wide, and usually
terminating towards the tongue in three lobes or
teeth which form two sinuses varying in depth<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>mentum</i> taken by itself affords no very striking
characters to which I need call your attention: I shall
only observe, that in <i>Hymenoptera</i> it is generally of a
triangular shape<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a>; but before I proceed to consider the
labial palpi, it will be proper to notice the remarkable
<i>labium</i> of <i>Orthopterous</i> insects, and of the <i>Libellulina</i>,
between which there is no little analogy. At first you
would imagine the terminal part of this organ in the former
to be the analogue of the tongue, or <i>ligula</i> F.; as it
is indeed generally regarded by modern Entomologists<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a>.
It seems, like the tongue of the <i>Carabi</i> L., <i>Dytisci</i>, &amp;c., to
be a distinct piece, which has below it both <i>labium</i> and
<i>mentum</i>; but when you look within the mouth, you will
find a linguiform organ<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a>, which evidently acts the part
of a tongue, and therefore ought to have the name; and
the piece just alluded to must either be regarded as the
termination of the lip, or as an external accompaniment
of the tongue, analogous, it may be, to the <i>paraglossÃ¦</i> in
bees<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a>. In a specimen of <i>Acrida viridissima</i> (<i>Locusta</i> F.)
which I dissected, the tongue is as long as the appendage
of the under-lip, and by its upper surface seems
to apply closely to it. In the <i>Libellulina</i> a similar organ
is discoverable<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a>, which on its upper-side terminates in
the <i>pharynx</i>, like that of one of the <i>HarpalidÃ¦</i> before
mentioned. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, therefore, I regard the
<i>labium</i> as consisting of three articulations, the upper one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
divided into two, three, or more lobes<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a>; the intermediate
one more directly answering to the <i>labium</i> of other insects,
and the basal one or <i>mentum</i>. This organ in the
<i>Libellulina</i> is of a different structure: it has only two
articulations representing <i>labium</i> and <i>mentum</i>; but the
former consists of three parallel pieces, the two exterior
ones rising higher than the intermediate one, and at their
inner angle having an acute sinus from which the palpi
emerge; and the intermediate piece, which is longitudinally
channelled, lapping over the inner side of the lateral
pieces. From the angle of the covered part of these
pieces, a subulate short horizontal horn points inwards
towards the tongue, which it must keep from closing
with the <i>labium</i><a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Palpi Labiales</i><a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a>.&mdash;The last-mentioned organs, the
<i>labial palpi</i>, next claim our attention; but before I advert
particularly to them, it will be proper to premise a few
words upon <i>palpi</i>, or feelers, in general. These are usually
jointed moveable organs, of a corneous or coriaceous
substance, attached by ligaments to the <i>labium</i> and
<i>maxillÃ¦</i>, and in the <i>Crustacea</i> even to the <i>mandibulÃ¦</i>.
Their joints, which are usually more or less obconical,
articulate also in each other by ligaments, with perhaps
some little mixture of the ball and socket. Their ends,
the last joint especially, seem furnished with nervous
<i>papillÃ¦</i> which indicate some peculiar sense, of which they
are the instrument. What that sense is has not been
clearly ascertained, and concerning which I shall enter
more into detail in another place. Their motion seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
restrained, at least in some, to two directions, towards
and from the mouth. They were called <i>palpi</i> or feelers,
because the insect has been supposed to use them in exploring
substances. There seem to be no organs in the
vertebrate animals directly analogous to the <i>palpi</i> of insects
and <i>Crustacea</i>, unless, perhaps, the <i>cirri</i> that emerge
from the lips of some fishes, as the cod, red mullet, &amp;c.
which LinnÃ© defines as used in exploring (<i>prÃ¦tentantes</i>).
Whether the <i>vibrissÃ¦</i>, miscalled <i>smellers</i>, of some quadrupeds
and birds have any reference to them, I will not
venture to affirm; but the feline tribe evidently use their
bristles as explorers, and they are planted chiefly in the
vicinity of the mouth.</p>

<p>Having made these general remarks, I shall now confine
myself to the <i>labial palpi</i>. I call them <i>labial</i> palpi,
because that term is in general use, and because in many
cases they really do emerge from what I consider as the
<i>labium</i>, as in most of the <i>chafers</i>; but they might with
equal propriety be denominated <i>lingual</i> palpi, since they
sometimes appear to emerge from the <i>tongue</i> as in the
stag-beetle (<i>Lucanus Cervus</i>). In some instances, as in
the Predaceous beetles, they seem to be common to both
<i>labium</i> and tongue, being attached at their base on the
upper side to the former, and on the under side to the
latter. As to their <i>situation</i>: they emerge from the <i>base</i>
of the <i>labium</i> in the locusts (<i>Locusta</i> Leach)<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a>; from its
<i>middle</i> in <i>Hister maximus</i><a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a>; from its <i>summit</i> in <i>Amblyterus</i>
MacLeay<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a>; and from its lateral margin in <i>Dynastes</i>
MacLeay, &amp;c. They consist of from <i>one</i> to <i>four</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
joints; which, I believe, they never exceed. They vary
in <i>length</i>; though generally shorter than the maxillary
palpi, yet in the ferocious tiger-beetles (<i>Cicindela</i> L.)
they equal them in length; and in the hive-bee and humble-bees,
and many other bees, they are considerably
longer<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>. The two first joints of these palpi, however,
in these <i>bees</i> are different in their structure from the two
last, being compressed and flat, or concave; and the two
last joints, instead of articulating with the apex of the
second, emerge from it below the apex: so that these
two first joints seem rather elevators of the palpi than
really parts of them<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a>. With respect to the relative <i>proportions</i>
of their joints to each other: in some cases the
first joint is the longest and thickest, the rest growing
gradually shorter and smaller<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a>; in others, the second is
the longest<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a>; in others, again, the third<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a>, and sometimes
the last<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a>; and often all are nearly of the same size and
length<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a>. They are more commonly <i>naked</i>, but sometimes
either generally or partially <i>hairy</i>. Thus in <i>Cicindela</i>,
the last joint but one is usually planted with long
snow-white bristles in a double series, while the rest of
the joints have none; and in <i>Copris</i> Latr. all of them are
extremely hairy. In <i>shape</i> they do not vary so much as
the maxillary palpi, being most frequently filiform or
subclavate, and sometimes setaceous; the last joint varies
more in shape than the rest, and is often remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
large, triangular, and shaped like the head of a hatchet<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a>;
and at others it resembles the moon in her first quarter<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a>.
In the great dragon-fly, or <i>demoiselle</i> if you prefer
the gentler French name (<i>Ãshna</i> F.) the labial palpi,
which are without any visible joints, are terminated by a
minute mucro or point<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a>. With regard to their <i>direction</i>
and flexure, they frequently, as in the instance just mentioned,
turn towards each other, and lie horizontally upon
the end of the <i>labium</i>. Sometimes, as in the <i>CicindelidÃ¦</i>,
they appear to point towards the tail of the insect, the last
joint rising, and forming an angle with the rest of the
feeler. In other instances they diverge laterally from the
<i>labium</i>, the last joint turning again towards it at a very
obtuse angle.</p>

<p>4. <i>MandibulÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a>.&mdash;Having considered the analogues of
the <i>lips</i> in our little beings, I must next call your attention
to the representatives of the <i>jaws</i>. The vertebrate
animals, you know, are mostly furnished with a single
pair of jaws, one above and the other below, in which the
teeth are planted and which have a vertical motion. But
insects are furnished with <i>two</i> pair of jaws, a pair of
upper-jaws and a pair of under-jaws, which have no
teeth planted in them, and the motion of which is horizontal.&mdash;I
shall begin with an account of the upper-jaws.
These by modern Entomologists, after Fabricius, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
denominated <i>mandibles</i> (<i>mandibulÃ¦</i>): a term appropriated
by LinnÃ© to the beaks of birds. The upper-jaws of insects
this great naturalist named <i>maxillÃ¦</i>&mdash;and not improperly,
since the office of mastication is more peculiarly
their office than that of the under-jaws, which Fabricius
has distinguished by that name: as the term <i>mandible</i>,
however, is generally adopted, I shall not attempt
to disturb it.</p>

<p>The <i>mandibles</i> close the mouth on each side under the
<i>labrum</i> or upper-lip. They are generally powerful organs,
of a hard <i>substance</i> like horn; but in the Lamellicorn
beetles of Mr. MacLeay's families of <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> and <i>CetoniadÃ¦</i>,
they are soft, membranous, and unapt for mastication.
In Coleopterous insects they commonly <i>articulate</i>
with the head by means of certain <i>apophyses</i> or processes,
of which in many cases there are <i>three</i> discoverable at
the exterior base of the mandibles; one, namely, at each
angle, and one in the middle. That on the lower side is
usually the most prominent, and wears the appearance
of the condyle of a bone: it is received by a corresponding
deep socket (or cotyloid cavity) of the cheek, in
which, being perfectly smooth and lubricous, it moves
readily, but without <i>synovia</i>, like a <i>rotula</i> in its <i>acetabulum</i>.
The upper one projects from the jaw, forms
the segment of a circle, and is concave also on its inner
face. A corresponding more shallow, or, as anatomists
speak, glenoid cavity of the cheek, where it meets the
upper-lip, receives it, and the concave part admits a lubricous
ball projecting from the cheek, upon which it turns<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
This structure you will find in the stag-beetle, and some
other timber-devourers. Other <i>Coleoptera</i> have only a
process of a similar structure at each of the dorsal angles
of the base of the mandible, the intermediate one being
wanting; and the articulation does not materially differ,
as far as I have examined them, in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and
<i>Neuroptera</i>. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, the structure approaches
more nearly to that of the stag-beetle, since there are
<i>three</i> prominences: it is thus well described by M. Marcel
de Serres: "This articulation," says he, "takes place
in <i>two</i> ways. At first, in the upper surface of the mandible,
and at its base, may be observed two small prominences
and a glenoid cavity; these prominences are received
in two glenoid cavities excavated in the shell of
the front, as the cavity of the mandible receives a small
prominence of the same part. Below the mandible, and
at its base, there is a kind of condyle, which has its play
in a cotyloid cavity excavated in the shell of the temple,
far below the eye, and at the extremity of the coriaceous
integument of the head<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a>." Within the head in this order,
at least in <i>Locusta</i> Leach, is a vertical <i>septum</i>, which
divides the head into two chambers, as it were, an occipital
and a frontal, consisting of a concave triangular
stem, terminating in two narrower concave triangular
branches, so as to resemble the letter Y, and forming
three openings, an upper triangular one, and two lateral
subquadrangular ones, which last are the cavities that receive
the base of the mandibles. This partition, which I
would name <i>Cephalophragma</i>, doubtless affords a point of
attachment to many of the muscles of the head. It does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
not appear to have been noticed, unless it be synonymous
with the <i>intermaxillary arcade</i> of Marcel de Serres<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a>.
Probably a corresponding support to the muscles, &amp;c.
may exist, as we have seen it does in <i>Vespa</i> L.<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a>, in many
other heads of the different Orders, which have not yet
fallen under examination. Many mandibles, as those of
the hornet &amp;c., appear to be suspended to the cavity of
the head on the inside by a marginal ligament sufficiently
relaxed to admit of their play: those of the <i>Orthoptera</i>,
M. Marcel de Serres informs us, are united to
the head by means of two cartilages, the outermost being
much the shortest, to which their moving muscles are
attached. These he considers as prolongations of the
substance of the mandible<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a>. The bottom of mandibles,
when cleared of the muscles &amp;c., inclines almost universally
to a triangular form; but in some cases, as in the
stag-beetle, it is nearly a <i>trapezium</i>. I cannot conclude
this subject without noticing the <i>motions</i> of the mandibles.
What the author lately quoted has said with regard
to those of the <i>Orthoptera</i>, will, I believe, apply
equally well to all the mandibulate orders. "The articulation
of mandibles with the skull appears to take place
by two points solely; and as these parts only execute
movements limited to a certain direction, they may be
referred to <i>ginglymus</i><a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a>.&mdash;The movements of mandibles
are limited to those from within outwards, and from
without inwards<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a>." Whether they are restricted from
any degree of vertical motion, has not yet been proved,
as the jaws of vertebrate animals move horizontally as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
well as vertically&mdash;so those of insects may have some
motion vertically as well as horizontally; and it seems
necessary for some of their operations that they should.
I am not anatomist enough to speak with confidence on
the subject, but the ball and socket articulation at the
lower part of the mandible, and the curving one at the
upper, though a kind of <i>ginglymus</i>, seems to imply a degree
of <i>rotatory</i> movement, however slight.</p>

<p>I must next say something upon the general shape of
these organs. Almost universally they incline to a triquetrous
or three-sided figure, with their external surface
convex, sometimes partially so, and their internal
concave. Most frequently they are arched, curving inwards;
but sometimes, as in <i>Prionus octangularis</i><a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>, a Capricorn
beetle, and others of that genus, they are nearly
straight; and in <i>Rhina barbirostris</i><a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a>, a most remarkable
Brazilian weevil, their curvature is outwards. In <i>Pholidotus
lepidotus</i> MacLeay, and <i>Lucanus Elephas</i>, two insects
of the stag-beetle tribe, they are bent downwards;
and in <i>Lucanus nebulosus</i> K. (<i>Ryssonotus</i> MacLeay) they
turn upwards<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a>. They are usually widest at the base,
and grow gradually more slender to the apex, but in the
hornet (<i>Vespa Crabro</i>) the reverse takes place, and they
increase in width from the base to the apex; and in the
hive-bee, and others of that tribe, they are dilated both
at base and apex, being narrowest in the middle; others
are nearly of the same width every where. In those
insects that use their mandibles principally for purposes
connected with their economy, they are often more broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
in proportion to their thickness, than they are in those
which use them principally for mastication. In the locust
tribes (<i>Locusta</i> Leach), they are extremely thick
and powerful organs, and fitted for their work of devastation;
but in the glow-worm (<i>Lampyris</i>), they are very
slender and minute. In those brilliant beetles, the <i>Buprestes</i>,
they are very short; but in the stag-beetles, and
those giants in the Capricorn tribe, the <i>Prioni</i>, they are
often very long<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a>. They either meet at the summit, lap
over each other, cross each other, or are protended
straight from the head; as you have doubtless observed
in the stag-beetle, whose terrific horns are mandibles of
this description. These organs are usually <i>symmetrical</i>,
but in some instances they are not: thus in <i>Hister lÃ¦vus</i>,
a kind of dung-beetle, the left hand mandible is longer
than the right; in <i>Creophilus maxillosus</i> K. (<i>Staphylinus</i>
L.), a common rove-beetle, in the left hand mandible
the tooth in the middle is bifid, and in the right
hand one intire; and in <i>Bolbocerus</i> K. the mandible of
one side, in some species the dexter, and in others the
sinister, has two teeth, and the other none.</p>

<p>The next circumstance with respect to these organs
which demands our attention, is the <i>teeth</i> with which
they are armed. These are merely processes of the substance
of the mandible, and not planted in it by <i>gomphosis</i><a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>,
as anatomists speak, as they are in vertebrate animals.
They have, however, in their interior, at the base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
at least, in the <i>Orthoptera</i>, a coriaceous <i>lamina</i> that separates
them in some sort from the body of the mandible<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a>.
Many insects, however, have mandibles without
teeth; some merely tapering to a sharp point, others obtuse
at the end, and others truncated<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a>. Of those that
have teeth, some have them on the inside at the base, as
<i>Manticora</i>, an African tiger-beetle<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a>; others in the middle,
as <i>Staphylinus olens</i>, a rove-beetle, <i>Lethrus cephalotes</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>;
others at the end, as many weevils (<i>Curculio</i> L.)<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a>;
others again on the back, as the <i>RutelidÃ¦</i>, a tribe
of chafers<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a>, and <i>Lethrus</i>, a beetle just named; others
once more on the lower side of the base, in the form
of a tooth or spine, as in <i>Melitta spinigera</i>, a species of
wild-bee, and some of its affinities<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a>; and lastly, others
on the upper side of the base in the form of a long tortuous
horn, as in that singular wasp <i>Synagris cornuta</i> F.
before noticed as a sexual character<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a>. In the stag-beetle
tribes (<i>Lucanus</i> L.) these teeth are often elongated
into short lateral branches, or a terminal fork<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a>. They
are sometimes truncated, sometimes obtuse, and sometimes
acute.</p>

<p>But with regard to their <i>kind</i>, it will be best to adopt
the ideas of M. Marcel de Serres; for though his remarks
are confined to the <i>Orthoptera</i>, they may be applied
with advantage to the teeth that arm the mandibles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
of insects in general. He perceives an analogy between
those of this Order and the teeth of quadrupeds; and
therefore divides them into <i>incisive</i> or cutting, <i>laniary</i>
or canine, and <i>molary</i> or grinding teeth. He denominates
those <i>incisives</i> that are broad, having in some degree
the shape of a wedge, their external surface being
convex, and their internal concave; whence they are evidently
formed for cutting. The <i>laniaries</i> are those which
have a conical shape, are often very acute, and in general
the longest of any; and in some insects, as the carnivorous
<i>Orthoptera</i> (and the <i>Libellulina</i>), they cross each
other. The <i>molaries</i> are the largest of all, and their
purpose is evidently to grind the food. There is never
only a single one to each mandible, while the number of
the incisives and laniaries is very variable. As the molaries
act the principal part in mastication, they are
nearer the inner base of the mandible or point of support:
they serve to grind the food, which has been first
divided by the incisives or torn by the laniaries. The
carnivorous tribes are destitute of them; in the omnivorous
ones they are very small, and in the herbivorous
ones they are very large<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a>. So that in some measure
you may conjecture the food of the animal from the teeth
that arm its mandibles. Of <i>incisive</i> teeth you may find
an example in those that arm the end of the mandibles
of most grasshoppers (<i>Locusta</i>), and of the leaf-cutter-bees
(<i>Megachile</i> Latr.)<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a>; of the <i>laniary</i> or canine teeth,
you will find good examples in the mandibles of the
dragon-flies (<i>Libellulina</i>); the two external teeth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
apex of those of the leaf-cutter bees may be regarded as
between the incisives and laniaries; and the pointed mandibles
without teeth may be deemed as terminating in a
laniary one<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a>. The lower part of the inner or concave
surface of the mandibles of grasshoppers will supply you
with instances of the <i>molary</i> teeth, and the apex, also, of
those of some weevils, as <i>Curculio Hancocki</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> But
the most remarkable example of a molary organ is exhibited
by many of the Lamellicorn beetles, especially those
that feed upon vegetables, whether flower or leaf.&mdash;Knoch,
who indeed was the first who proposed calling
mandibles according to their teeth, incisive, laniary, or
molary, but who does not explain his system clearly,
observed that the mandibles of some <i>MelolonthÃ¦</i> have a
projection with transverse, deep furrows, resembling a
file, for the purpose of bruising the leaves they feed upon<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a>:
and M. Cuvier, long after, observed that the larvÃ¦ of
the stag-beetle have towards their base a flat, striated,
molary surface; though he does not appear to have noticed
it in any perfect insect<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a>. This structure, with the
exception of the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> and <i>CetoniadÃ¦</i>, seems to
extend very generally through the above tribe; since it
may be traced even in <i>Geotrupes</i>, the common dung-chafer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
in which at the base of one mandible is a concave
molary surface, and in the other a convex one, but
without any furrows: a circumstance that often distinguishes
those that have furrows.&mdash;In the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>
the affinity of structure with the <i>MelolonthidÃ¦</i> &amp;c. is
more pronounced, the furrows to which ridges in the
other mandible correspond being reduced to one or two
wide and deep ones; whereas in some of the latter tribe
they are very numerous. These mandibles, in many
cases, at their apex are furnished with incisive teeth to
cut off their food, and with miniature mill-stones to
grind it<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>. The part here alluded to I call the <i>Mola</i>.</p>

<p>Were I to ask you what your idea is with regard to
the use of the organs we are considering, you would
perhaps reply without hesitation, "Of what possible use
can the <i>jaws</i> of insects be but to <i>masticate</i> their food?"
But in this you would in many instances be much mistaken;
as you will own directly if you only look at the
mandibles of the stag-beetle&mdash;these protended and formidable
weapons, as well as those of several other beetles,
cannot be thus employed. "Of what other use,
then, can they be?" you will say. In the particular instance
here named, their use, independent of mastication,
has not been satisfactorily ascertained; but in many
other cases it has. Recollect, for instance, what I told
you in a former letter, of those larvÃ¦ that use their unguiform
mandibles as instruments of <i>motion</i><a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a>. Again:
amongst the Hymenopterous tribes, whose industry and
varied economy have so often amused and interested you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
many have no other tools to aid them in their various
labours and mechanical arts: to some they supply the
place of trowels, spades, and pick-axes; to others that of
saws, scissors, and knives&mdash;with many other uses that
might be named. In fact, with the insects of this intire
Order mastication seems merely a <i>secondary</i>, if it is at
any time their use. Still comprehending in one view all
the mandibulate Orders, though some use their mandibles
especially for purposes connected with their economy,
yet their most general and <i>primary</i> use is the division,
laceration, and mastication of their food; and this more
exclusively than can be affirmed of the under-jaws (<i>maxillÃ¦</i>).
This will appear evident to you, when you consider
that insects in their larva state, in which universally
their primary business is <i>feeding</i>, with very few exceptions
use the organs in question for the purpose of mastication,
even in tribes, as the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, that have only
rudiments of them in their perfect state&mdash;while the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>
ordinarily are altogether unapt for such use. The
exceptions I have just alluded to are chiefly confined to
the instance of suctorious mandibles; or those which,
being furnished at the end with an orifice, the animal inserting
them into its prey, imbibes their juices through
it. This is the case with the larvÃ¦ of some <i>Dytisci</i>, <i>Hemerobius</i>,
and <i>Myrmeleon</i><a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a>; and spiders have a similar
opening in the claw of their mandibles, which is supposed
to instil venom into their prey<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a>.</p>

<p>Under this head I must not pass without notice an
appendage of the mandibles, to be found in some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
rove-beetles (<i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>), as in <i>Ocypus</i>, <i>Staphylinus</i>,
and <i>Creophilus</i> Kirby. In the first of these it is a curved,
narrow, white, subdiaphanous, submembranous, or rather
cartilaginous piece, proceeding from the upper side of
the base of the mandible<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a>; in the second it is broader,
straighter, and fringed internally and at the end with
hairs; and in this at first it wears the appearance of being
attached laterally to the mandible under the tooth<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a>,
but if closely examined, you will find that it is separate:
in <i>Creophilus maxillosus</i> it is broader. This is the part
I have named <i>prostheca</i>. It is perhaps useful in preventing
the food from working out upwards during mastication.</p>

<p>5. <i>MaxillÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a>. The antagonist organs to the mandible
in the lower side of the head, are the under-jaws, or <i>maxillÃ¦</i>&mdash;so
denominated by the illustrious Entomologist of
Kiel. LinnÃ© appears to have overlooked them, except
in the case of his genus <i>Apis</i>, in which he regards them,
and properly, as the sheath of the tongue. De Geer
looked upon them in general as part of the apparatus of
the under-lip or <i>labium</i>; and such in fact they are, as
will appear when we consider them more particularly.
Fabricius has founded his system for the most part upon
these organs, the principal diagnostic of ten out of his
thirteen Classes (properly Orders) being taken from them;
and in the modern, which may be termed the <i>eclectic</i>, system,
although the Orders are not founded upon them,
yet the characters of genera, and sometimes of large
tribes, are derived from them: and as they appear less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
liable to variation than almost any other organ, as Mr.
W. S. MacLeay has judiciously observed, there seems
good reason for employing them&mdash;it is therefore of importance
that you should be well acquainted with them.</p>

<p>Their <i>situation</i> is usually below each mandible, on each
side of the <i>labium;</i> towards which they are often somewhat
inclined, so that their tips meet when closed. In
some cases, as in the Predaceous beetles (<i>Carabus</i> L. &amp;c.),
they exactly correspond with the mandibles; but in others
their direction with respect to the head is more longitudinal,
as in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, &amp;c. In <i>substance</i> they
may be generally stated to be less hard than those organs;
yet in some instances, as in the <i>Libellulina</i>, <i>AnoplognathidÃ¦</i>,
&amp;c. they vie with them, and in the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>
and <i>CetoniadÃ¦</i> exceed them, in hardness. In the
bees, and many other <i>Hymenoptera</i>, they are soft and
leathery. Their <i>articulation</i> is usually by means of the
hinge on which they sit: it appears entirely ligamentous,
and they are probably attached to the <i>labium</i> at the
base, or <i>mentum</i>&mdash;at least this is evidently the case with
the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, in which the opening of the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>
pushes forth the <i>labium</i> and its apparatus. In that remarkable
genus related to the glow-worms, now called
<i>Phengodes</i> (<i>Lampyris plumosa</i> F.), and in the case-worm
flies (<i>Trichoptera</i> K.), the <i>maxillÃ¦</i> appear to be connate
with the <i>labium</i>, or at least at their base.&mdash;As to their
<i>composition</i>, these organs consist of several pieces or portions.
At their base they articulate with a piece more
or less triangular, which I call the hinge (<i>Cardo</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a>. This
on its inner side is often elongated towards the interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
of the base of the <i>labium</i>, to which it is, as I have just
observed, probably attached. This elongate process of
the hinge in <i>Apis</i>, <i>Bombus</i>, &amp;c. appears a separate articulation;
and the two together form an angle upon which
the <i>mentum</i> sits<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a>, and by this the <i>maxilla</i> acts upon the
labial apparatus.</p>

<p>The next piece is the <i>stipes</i> or stalk of the <i>maxilla</i>.
This is the part that articulates with the hinge, and may
be regarded in some cases, as in the <i>Orthoptera</i> &amp;c., as
the whole of the <i>maxilla</i> below the feeler; and in others,
as in the <i>GeotrupidÃ¦</i>, <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i> &amp;c., as only the back
of it, the inside forming the lower lobe. This piece is
often harder and more corneous than the terminal part,
is linear, often longitudinally angular, and in the bee-tribes
(<i>Apis</i> L.) is remarkable on its inner side for a series
of bristles parallel to each other like the teeth of a
comb<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a>. In <i>Pogonophorus</i> Latr., a kind of dor or clock-beetle,
it is armed on the back with four jointed spines,
the intermediate one being forked<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a>. M. Latreille has
thus described the stipes of the <i>maxillÃ¦</i> of <i>Coleoptera</i>:
"Next comes the stalk," says he, "which consists of
three parts: one occupies the back and bears the feeler;
the second forms the middle of the anterior face, and its
figure is triangular; the third fills the posterior space
comprised between the two preceding; and is that which
is of most consequence in the use of the <i>maxilla</i>; the anterior
feeler, where there are two, the <i>galea</i>, and the
other appendages that are of service in deglutition, are
part of that piece<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>third</i> and terminal portion of the <i>maxilla</i> is formed
by the lobe, or lobes (<i>Lobi</i>). This may be called the
most important part of the organ, since it is that which
often acts upon the food, when preparing for deglutition.
When armed with teeth or spines at the end,
its substance is as hard as that of the mandibles; but
when not so circumstanced, it is usually softer, resembling
leather, or even membrane<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a>; and sometimes
the middle part is coriaceous, and the margin membranous.
This part is either simple, consisting only of <i>one</i>
lobe, as you will find to be the case with the <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
<i>DynastidÃ¦</i>, <i>Nemognatha</i>, and several other beetles;
or it is compound, consisting of <i>two</i> lobes. In the
former case, the lobe is sometimes very long, as in the
bee tribes, and the singular genus of beetles mentioned
above<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a>, <i>Nemognatha</i>; and at others very short, as in
<i>Hister</i>, &amp;c. The bilobed <i>maxillÃ¦</i> present several different
types of form. Nearest to those with one lobe are
those whose lower lobe is attached longitudinally to the
inner side of the stalk of the organ, above which it
scarcely rises. Of this description is the <i>maxilla</i> in the
common dung-beetle (<i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>), and rove-beetle
(<i>Staphylinus olens</i>).<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> Another kind of formation
is where the lower lobe is only a little shorter than the
upper: this occurs in a kind of chafer (<i>Macraspis tetradactyla</i>
MacLeay).<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> A third is where the upper lobe
covers the lower as a shield; as you will find in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
<i>Orthoptera</i> order, and the <i>Libellulina</i>, and almost in <i>Meloe</i><a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a>.
A fourth form is where the upper lobe somewhat resembles
the galeate <i>maxilla</i> just named; but consists of two
joints. This exists in <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> The last kind
I shall notice is when the upper lobe not only consists of
two joints, but is cylindrical, and assumes the aspect of
a feeler or <i>palpus</i><a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a>. This is the common character of
almost all the Predaceous beetles (<i>Entomophagi</i> Latr.).
This lobe, which has been regarded as an additional
feeler, is strictly analogous to the upper lobe in other insects,
and therefore should rather be denominated a palpiform
lobe than a <i>palpus</i>. Where there are two lobes,
the upper one is most commonly the longest; but in
many species of the tribe last mentioned the lower one
equals or exceeds it in length<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a>.</p>

<p>The lobes vary in form, clothing, and appendages.
The upper palpiform lobe in those beetles just mentioned,
in general varies scarcely at all in <i>form</i>; but the
genus <i>Cychrus</i> (which is remarkable for a retrocession
from the general type of form of the <i>Carabi</i> L. making an
approach towards that of those <i>Heteromera</i> which, from
their black body and revolting aspect, Latreille has named
<i>Melosomes</i>,) affords an exception, the upper joint being
rather flat, linear-lanceolate, incurved, and covering the
lower lobe<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a>, which it somewhat resembles. The lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
lobe also in this tribe varies as little as the upper, being
shaped like the last joint of that lobe in <i>Cychrus</i> just described,
except that in <i>Cicindela</i> it is narrowest in the
middle<a name="FNanchor_1276_1276" id="FNanchor_1276_1276"></a><a href="#Footnote_1276_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a>. In other tribes the upper valve is sometimes
linear and rounded at the apex, and the lower truncated,
as in <i>Staphylinus olens</i><a name="FNanchor_1277_1277" id="FNanchor_1277_1277"></a><a href="#Footnote_1277_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a>; sometimes the upper one is
truncated or obtuse, and the lower acute, as in <i>Trogosita</i>
and <i>Parnus</i><a name="FNanchor_1278_1278" id="FNanchor_1278_1278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1278_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a>. In <i>Ptinus</i>, another tribe of beetles, before
noticed as injurious to our museums<a name="FNanchor_1279_1279" id="FNanchor_1279_1279"></a><a href="#Footnote_1279_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a>, the reverse of
this takes place, the upper-lobe, which is the smallest
and shortest, being acute, and the lower truncated<a name="FNanchor_1280_1280" id="FNanchor_1280_1280"></a><a href="#Footnote_1280_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a>. In
<i>Blaps</i> both are acute<a name="FNanchor_1281_1281" id="FNanchor_1281_1281"></a><a href="#Footnote_1281_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a>. In <i>Rhipiphorus</i> and <i>Scolytus</i> the
lobes are nearly obsolete. The lower lobe is bifid in
<i>Languria</i>, a North American genus of beetles, so as to
give the maxilla the appearance of three lobes<a name="FNanchor_1282_1282" id="FNanchor_1282_1282"></a><a href="#Footnote_1282_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a>; and in
<i>Erotylus</i>, a South American one, the upper is triangular<a name="FNanchor_1283_1283" id="FNanchor_1283_1283"></a><a href="#Footnote_1283_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>:
it is often oblong, quadrangular, linear, &amp;c. in
others.&mdash;In those that have only one lobe the shape also
varies. In <i>Gyrinus</i>, the beetle that whirls round and
round on the surface of every pool, which, though it belongs
to the Predaceous tribe, has only one lobe, the lobe
represents a mandible in shape of the laniary kind, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
trigonal and acute<a name="FNanchor_1284_1284" id="FNanchor_1284_1284"></a><a href="#Footnote_1284_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a>; and in the <i>AnoplognathidÃ¦</i>, a New
Holland tribe of chafers, in which it is, as it were,
broken, the lobe forming an angle with the stalk, it is
concavo-convex and obtuse, and somewhat figures a
molary tooth<a name="FNanchor_1285_1285" id="FNanchor_1285_1285"></a><a href="#Footnote_1285_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a>. In the first tribe into which the bees
(<i>Apis</i> L.) have been divided (<i>Melitta</i> Kirby), the lobe is
often linear or strap-shaped, and bifid at the apex; and
in the second (<i>Apis</i> K.) lanceolate and intire<a name="FNanchor_1286_1286" id="FNanchor_1286_1286"></a><a href="#Footnote_1286_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a>. In <i>Cerocoma</i>
it is long and narrow<a name="FNanchor_1287_1287" id="FNanchor_1287_1287"></a><a href="#Footnote_1287_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a>. More variations in form
might be named, but these are sufficient to give you a
general idea of them in this respect. With regard to
their <i>clothing</i>, I have not much to observe&mdash;in examining
the Predaceous beetles you will observe, that the interior
margin of the lower incurved lobe is fringed with
stiff bristles or slender spines, and in many other beetles
either one or both lobes have a thick coating or brush of
stiffish hairs<a name="FNanchor_1288_1288" id="FNanchor_1288_1288"></a><a href="#Footnote_1288_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a>; but in several cases only the apex of the
lobe is hairy. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> order, and many of the
<i>MelolonthidÃ¦</i> or chafers, the whole <i>maxilla</i> is without
hairs, or nearly so.</p>

<p>The <i>appendages</i> of the <i>maxillÃ¦</i> are next to be noticed.
These are principally their claws, or laniary teeth; for
they are seldom armed with incisive or molary teeth.
The whole tribe of Predaceous beetles, with few exceptions,
have the inner lobe of their <i>maxilla</i> armed with a
terminal claw, which in the <i>CicindelidÃ¦</i> articulates with
the lobe, and is moveable, but in the rest of the tribe is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
fixed<a name="FNanchor_1289_1289" id="FNanchor_1289_1289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1289_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>. In <i>Phoberus</i> MacLeay the lower lobe has two
spines<a name="FNanchor_1290_1290" id="FNanchor_1290_1290"></a><a href="#Footnote_1290_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a>. In <i>Locusta</i> this lobe has three or four spines
or laniary teeth, and in <i>Ãshna</i> there are six, which, like
the claw of <i>Cicindela</i>, are moveable<a name="FNanchor_1291_1291" id="FNanchor_1291_1291"></a><a href="#Footnote_1291_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a>. In others both
lobes terminate in a single spine or claw: this is the case
with <i>Paxillus</i> MacLeay<a name="FNanchor_1292_1292" id="FNanchor_1292_1292"></a><a href="#Footnote_1292_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a>. In <i>Passalus</i>, nearly related
to the last genus, the upper lobe is armed with a single
spine, and the lower one with two<a name="FNanchor_1293_1293" id="FNanchor_1293_1293"></a><a href="#Footnote_1293_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a>. Those <i>maxillÃ¦</i> that
terminate in a single lobe are also often distinguished by
the spines or teeth with which it is armed; thus in a
nondescript chafer belonging to the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i> (<i>Archon</i>
K. MS.) it terminates in <i>two</i> short teeth; in that remarkable
Petalocerous genus <i>Hexodon</i> Oliv. in <i>three</i> truncated
<i>incisive</i> ones<a name="FNanchor_1294_1294" id="FNanchor_1294_1294"></a><a href="#Footnote_1294_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a>; in <i>Dynastes Hercules</i> in three <i>acute</i>
spines<a name="FNanchor_1295_1295" id="FNanchor_1295_1295"></a><a href="#Footnote_1295_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a>. <i>Four</i> similar ones arm the apex of the <i>maxilla</i>
in that tribe of <i>RutelidÃ¦</i> which have striated elytra; and
<i>five</i> that are stout and triquetrous those of <i>Melolontha
Stigma</i> F. Many others have <i>six</i> spines, sometimes arranged
in a triple series<a name="FNanchor_1296_1296" id="FNanchor_1296_1296"></a><a href="#Footnote_1296_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a>. Besides teeth or spines, in
some cases the lobes of <i>maxillÃ¦</i> terminate in several long
and slender <i>laciniÃ¦</i> or lappets fringed with hairs. At
least those of a <i>Leptura</i> (<i>L. quadrifasciata</i> L.) described
by De Geer, appear to be thus circumstanced. He conjectures
that this beetle uses its <i>maxillÃ¦</i> to collect the
honey from the flowers<a name="FNanchor_1297_1297" id="FNanchor_1297_1297"></a><a href="#Footnote_1297_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>As the principal use of the mandibles is cutting and
masticating, so that of the organs we are considering
seems to be primarily that of <i>holding</i> the food and preventing
it from falling while the former are employed
upon it. I say this is their <i>primary</i> use; for I would by
no means deny that they assist occasionally in comminuting
or lacerating it. In fact, were there no organs
appropriated to this use, and if both mandibles and <i>maxillÃ¦</i>
were employed at the same time in comminuting the
food, it seems to me that it must fall from the mouth.
In a large proportion of insects the lobes of the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>
are not at all calculated for laceration or comminution;
and in those tribes&mdash;as the <i>MelolonthidÃ¦</i>, <i>RutelidÃ¦</i>, <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>&mdash;in
which they seem most fitted for that purpose,
the mandibles have <i>incisive</i> teeth at their apex, and
at their base a powerful <i>mola</i> or grinder: circumstances
which prove, that even in this case the business of mastication
principally devolves upon them.</p>

<p>6. <i>Palpi Maxillares</i><a name="FNanchor_1298_1298" id="FNanchor_1298_1298"></a><a href="#Footnote_1298_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a>. There is one circumstance that
particularly distinguishes the <i>maxillÃ¦</i> from the mandibles&mdash;they
are <i>palpigerous</i>, as well as the under-lip. The
feelers, or palpi, emerge usually from a sinus observable
on the back of the <i>maxillÃ¦</i> where the upper lobe and
stalk meet. Their articulation does not materially differ
from that of the labial palpi. Each <i>maxilla</i> has properly
only <i>one</i> feeler; but, as was lately observed<a name="FNanchor_1299_1299" id="FNanchor_1299_1299"></a><a href="#Footnote_1299_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a>, in certain
tribes the upper lobe is jointed and palpiform, which
has occasioned it to be considered as a feeler, and these
tribes have been regarded as having six feelers. The
most general rule with regard to the <i>length</i> of the <i>palpi</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
is, that the maxillary shall be longer than the labial; but
the reverse often takes place. In many <i>bees</i> the maxillary
consist only of a <i>single</i> joint, and are very <i>short</i>;
while the labial consist of <i>four</i>, and are very <i>long</i><a name="FNanchor_1300_1300" id="FNanchor_1300_1300"></a><a href="#Footnote_1300_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a>: and
in some insects (as in <i>Pogonophorus</i> Latr.) the four palpi
are of equal length<a name="FNanchor_1301_1301" id="FNanchor_1301_1301"></a><a href="#Footnote_1301_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a>. The antennÃ¦ are most commonly
longer than the palpi; but in several aquatic beetles, as
<i>Elophorus</i>, <i>Hydrophilus</i>, &amp;c., whose antennÃ¦ in the water
are not in use, the organs we are considering are the
longest.&mdash;As to the <i>number</i> of their articulations, it varies
from one to six; which number they are not known
to exceed. In each of the Orders a kind of law seems
to have been observed as to the number of joints both
in the maxillary and labial palpi, but which admits of
several exceptions. Thus in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, the <i>natural</i>
number may be set at <i>four</i> joints for the <i>maxillary</i>, and
<i>three</i> for the <i>labial</i> palpi: yet sometimes, as in <i>Stenus</i>,
<i>Notoxus</i>, &amp;c., the <i>former</i> have only <i>three</i> joints, and the
<i>latter</i>, as in <i>Stenus</i> and <i>Tillus</i>, only <i>two</i>. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>
the law enjoins <i>five</i> for the <i>maxillary</i>, and <i>three</i> for
the <i>labial</i>; and to this I have hitherto observed no exception.
In the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, the rule is <i>six</i> and <i>four</i>,
but with considerable exceptions, especially as to the
<i>maxillary</i> palpi, which vary from <i>six</i> joints to a <i>single</i>
one: thus in the hive-bee and the humble-bee, the labials,
including the two flat joints or elevators, have four
joints, while the maxillaries are not jointed at all<a name="FNanchor_1302_1302" id="FNanchor_1302_1302"></a><a href="#Footnote_1302_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a>. In
<i>Chrysis</i>, in which the latter consist of <i>five</i>, the former are
reduced to <i>three</i>. The <i>Libellulina</i> may almost be regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
as having no maxillary palpi, since they exhibit
no organ that is distinctly palpiform. It seems to me
that the upper lobe of their maxilla, which articulates
with the stalk in the same manner as a feeler, may
be regarded as an instance in which that lobe and the
feeler coalesce into one; and the mucro that proceeds
from the lobe has the aspect of an emerging feeler, and
corresponds somewhat with the labial one above noticed<a name="FNanchor_1303_1303" id="FNanchor_1303_1303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1303_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a>.
In the remainder of the <i>Neuroptera</i> and the
<i>Trichoptera</i>, the prevailing number is <i>five</i> and <i>three</i>.
In the latter there are exceptions, which will furnish
good characters for genera. In the <i>Lepidoptera</i> we find
<i>two</i>, and sometimes <i>three</i>, the maxillary being very minute<a name="FNanchor_1304_1304" id="FNanchor_1304_1304"></a><a href="#Footnote_1304_1304" class="fnanchor">[1304]</a>.
The <i>Diptera</i> Order presents two tribes in this
respect quite distinct from each other. The most natural
number of joints in the maxillary palpi of the <i>TipulidÃ¦</i>,
<i>CulicidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c. is <i>four</i> or <i>five</i>: the last joint, however,
in <i>Tipula</i>, <i>Ctenocera</i>, &amp;c. like that of the antennÃ¦
in <i>Tabanus</i> L., appears to consist of a number of very
minute joints<a name="FNanchor_1305_1305" id="FNanchor_1305_1305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1305_1305" class="fnanchor">[1305]</a>; but in the <i>AsilidÃ¦</i> and <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., the
number <i>two</i> seems to be most prevalent<a name="FNanchor_1306_1306" id="FNanchor_1306_1306"></a><a href="#Footnote_1306_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a>. The <i>labial</i> palpi
in this order are obsolete.&mdash;As to <i>shape</i>, the maxillary
palpi, as well as the labial, are usually filiform; but in
the weevil tribes (<i>Curculio</i> L.) they are most commonly
very short and conical<a name="FNanchor_1307_1307" id="FNanchor_1307_1307"></a><a href="#Footnote_1307_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a>; in the chafers (<i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> L.)
they usually are thickest at the apex<a name="FNanchor_1308_1308" id="FNanchor_1308_1308"></a><a href="#Footnote_1308_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a>; in <i>Megachile</i> and
<i>Euglossa</i>, wild bees, they are setaceous, growing gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
more slender from the base to the summit<a name="FNanchor_1309_1309" id="FNanchor_1309_1309"></a><a href="#Footnote_1309_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a>: a tribe
of small water-beetles (<i>Haliplus</i>), the saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i>
L.), and several other <i>Hymenoptera</i>, have them
thickest in the middle<a name="FNanchor_1310_1310" id="FNanchor_1310_1310"></a><a href="#Footnote_1310_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a>. Their most important part,
however, and that which varies most in form, is the <i>terminal</i>
joint:&mdash;of this I have already related some singular
instances<a name="FNanchor_1311_1311" id="FNanchor_1311_1311"></a><a href="#Footnote_1311_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a>, and shall now describe a few more. This
joint is sometimes acute, at others blunt, at others truncated:
in figure it is ovate, oblong, obtriangular, hatchet-shaped,
lunate, transverse, conical, mammillate, subulate,
branched, chelate, laciniate, lamellate, &amp;c. &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1312_1312" id="FNanchor_1312_1312"></a><a href="#Footnote_1312_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a>: terms
which I shall more fully explain to you hereafter, and
which I only mention here to show the numerous variations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
as to figure, of which this joint exhibits examples.
The palpi in general at their vertex are often rather concave;
and this concavity is formed by a thin papillose
membrane, which it is supposed the animal has the
power of pushing out a little, so as to apply it to surfaces.
The <i>primary</i> use of the palpi of insects will be
considered when I treat of their senses; but they probably
answer more purposes than one. For instance, when
I was once examining, under a lens, the proceedings of
a species of <i>Mordella</i>, which was busily employed in the
blossom of some umbelliferous plant, it appeared to me
to open the anthers with its maxillary palpi, and they
often held the anther between them: when not so employed,
they were kept in intense vibration, more than
even its antennÃ¦; and at the same time, as far as I could
judge, an <i>Elater</i> made the same use of them.</p>

<p>7. <i>Lingua</i><a name="FNanchor_1313_1313" id="FNanchor_1313_1313"></a><a href="#Footnote_1313_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a>.&mdash;This name was applied by LinnÃ© to the
part in insects representing the <i>tongue</i> in vertebrate animals;
and as it performs most of the common offices of
a tongue, and the <i>pharynx</i> is situated with respect to it,
as we shall presently see, nearly as it is in those animals,
there seems no more reason for giving it a new
name, than there is for giving a new name to the head
or legs of insects, because in some respects they differ
from those of the higher animals. I shall not therefore
call it <i>Ligula</i>, with Fabricius and Latreille, nor <i>Labium</i>,
with Cuvier and others, but adhere to the original term,
which every one understands.</p>

<p>The <i>tongue</i> lies between the two <i>lips</i>&mdash;the <i>labrum</i> and
<i>labium</i>. On its upper side, at the base, it meets the palate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
or roof of the mouth, below which it is attached, it
may be presumed, by its roots to the crust of the head,
on each side the <i>pharynx</i> or swallow; and on its lower
side, in many cases, it is attached to the <i>labium</i>, and that
very closely, so as to appear to be merely a part of it,
and to form its extremity: but in the <i>Orthoptera</i> and
<i>Libellulina</i>, it is more free, and in form somewhat resembling
the tongue of the quadrupeds<a name="FNanchor_1314_1314" id="FNanchor_1314_1314"></a><a href="#Footnote_1314_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a>.&mdash;In <i>substance</i>
the tongue varies. In general it seems something between
membrane and cartilage; but in the Predaceous
beetles, in which it is not covered by the <i>labium</i>, it approaches
nearer to the substance of the general integument,
and in <i>Anthia</i> F. it is quite hard and horny:&mdash;that
just mentioned of the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Libellulina</i>
is more fleshy<a name="FNanchor_1315_1315" id="FNanchor_1315_1315"></a><a href="#Footnote_1315_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a>. With regard to its <i>station</i>, in many
cases, as in the instance just named, in the Lamellicorn
tribe (<i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> L.) and others, it is, when unemployed,
concealed within the mouth; the lips, mandibles, and
maxillÃ¦ all closing over it. The tongue of some <i>Hymenoptera</i>
also is retractile within the mouth. "When
<i>ants</i> are disposed to drink," says M. P. Huber, "there
comes out from between their lower jaws, which are
much shorter than the upper, a minute, conical, fleshy,
yellowish process, which performs the office of a tongue,
being pushed out and drawn in alternately: it appears
to proceed from the lower-lip.&mdash;This lip has the power
of moving itself forwards in conjunction with the lower
jaws: and when the insect wishes to lap, all this apparatus
moves forward; so that the tongue, which is very
short, does not require to lengthen itself much to reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
the liquid<a name="FNanchor_1316_1316" id="FNanchor_1316_1316"></a><a href="#Footnote_1316_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a>." M. Lamarck thinks that the <i>labium</i> of
insects has a <i>vertical</i> motion (<i>de haut en bas ou de bas
en haut</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1317_1317" id="FNanchor_1317_1317"></a><a href="#Footnote_1317_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a>. This it certainly has in some degree; but it
has also, as in the above case, a more powerful <i>horizontal</i>
one, which is produced, in <i>Hymenoptera</i> at least,
by the opening of the maxillÃ¦&mdash;as I have already observed<a name="FNanchor_1318_1318" id="FNanchor_1318_1318"></a><a href="#Footnote_1318_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a>.</p>

<p>I have little to say with respect to the <i>structure</i> of the
tongue: it generally seems to be without articulations;
but in many bees it articulates with the <i>labium</i> where it
enters it, so as when unemployed to form a fold with it.
In the hive-bee it terminates in a kind of knob or button,
which has been falsely supposed to be perforated for imbibing
the honey by suction. The upper part of this
tongue is cartilaginous, and remarkable for a number
of transverse rings: below the middle, it consists of a
membrane, longitudinally folded in inaction, but capable
of being inflated to a considerable size: this membranous
bag receives the honey which the tongue, as it
were, laps from the flowers, and conveys it to the <i>pharynx</i><a name="FNanchor_1319_1319" id="FNanchor_1319_1319"></a><a href="#Footnote_1319_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a>.
In <i>Stenus</i> this organ is retractile, and consists
of two joints<a name="FNanchor_1320_1320" id="FNanchor_1320_1320"></a><a href="#Footnote_1320_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>shape</i> of the tongue of insects probably varies as
much as any other part; but as it is apt to shrink when
dried<a name="FNanchor_1321_1321" id="FNanchor_1321_1321"></a><a href="#Footnote_1321_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a>, and is not easy to come at, we know but little of
its various configurations:&mdash;in the bees it is very long,
in most other insects very short. Though frequently
simple and undivided, in many cases it presents a different
conformation. Thus in the saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
it terminates in three equal lobes<a name="FNanchor_1322_1322" id="FNanchor_1322_1322"></a><a href="#Footnote_1322_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a>; in <i>Stomis</i> and <i>Geotrupes</i>
in three unequal ones, the intermediate being very
short<a name="FNanchor_1323_1323" id="FNanchor_1323_1323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1323_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a>; in <i>Carabus</i>, in three short teeth<a name="FNanchor_1324_1324" id="FNanchor_1324_1324"></a><a href="#Footnote_1324_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a>; in <i>Pogonophorus</i>
it represents a trident<a name="FNanchor_1325_1325" id="FNanchor_1325_1325"></a><a href="#Footnote_1325_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a>; in the wasp it is bifid, each
lobe being tipped with a callosity<a name="FNanchor_1326_1326" id="FNanchor_1326_1326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1326_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a>; in <i>Melolontha Stigma</i>
it is bipartite<a name="FNanchor_1327_1327" id="FNanchor_1327_1327"></a><a href="#Footnote_1327_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a>; in <i>Elaphrus</i>, the analogue of the tiger-beetles,
it terminates in a single tooth or point; in the
aquatic beetles, <i>Dytiscus</i> L., it is quadrangular and without
teeth<a name="FNanchor_1328_1328" id="FNanchor_1328_1328"></a><a href="#Footnote_1328_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a>; in some <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i> it is concavo-convex,
and forms a demitube; and in others it is nearly cylindrical<a name="FNanchor_1329_1329" id="FNanchor_1329_1329"></a><a href="#Footnote_1329_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a>.</p>

<p>In many insects it has no <i>hairs</i>, but in the Predaceous
beetles it generally terminates in a couple of bristles<a name="FNanchor_1330_1330" id="FNanchor_1330_1330"></a><a href="#Footnote_1330_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a>.
In the hive- humble- and other bees, it is extremely
hairy<a name="FNanchor_1331_1331" id="FNanchor_1331_1331"></a><a href="#Footnote_1331_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a>; a circumstance which probably enables it more
effectually to despoil the flowers of their nectar. In <i>Geotrupes
stercorarius</i>, the common dungchafer, and <i>Melolontha
Stigma</i> lately mentioned, the lobes of the tongue
are fringed with incurved hairs<a name="FNanchor_1332_1332" id="FNanchor_1332_1332"></a><a href="#Footnote_1332_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a>; and in <i>Ãshna</i> it is
hairy on the upper side, each hair or bristle crowning a
minute tubercle. In many cases the tongue is attended,
and sometimes sheathed at the base, by two usually membranous
appendages:&mdash;these the learned Illiger has denominated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
<i>paraglossÃ¦</i>; and I shall adopt his term. You
will find them frequently attached to the tongue of the
Predaceous beetles<a name="FNanchor_1333_1333" id="FNanchor_1333_1333"></a><a href="#Footnote_1333_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a>, and to that of many <i>Hymenoptera</i>.
In the hive-bee and humble-bee they are short, and take
their origin within the <i>labial</i> feelers<a name="FNanchor_1334_1334" id="FNanchor_1334_1334"></a><a href="#Footnote_1334_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a>: in <i>Euglossa</i>, another
bee, they are long, involute at the tips, and, what
is not usual with them, very hairy<a name="FNanchor_1335_1335" id="FNanchor_1335_1335"></a><a href="#Footnote_1335_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a>: in the wasp, like
the lobes of the tongue, they are tipped with a callosity.</p>

<p>Under this head I may observe to you, that the insects
whose oral organs we are considering besides a
<i>tongue</i> appear likewise to be furnished with a <i>palate</i> (<i>Palatum</i>).
This, though a part of the roof of the mouth,
is not precisely in the situation of the palate of vertebrate
animals, since it seems rather the internal lining of the
<i>labrum</i>. If you take the common dragon-fly (<i>Ãshna
viatica</i>), you will find that the under side of this part
and of the <i>rhinarium</i> is lined with a quadrangular fleshy
cushion, beset, like the upper surface of the tongue, with
minute black tubercles, crowned with a bristle. This
cushion is divided transversely into two parts by a depression;
the anterior or outer piece being attached to
the <i>labrum</i>, and the other piece to the <i>rhinarium</i>. The
former has a central longitudinal cavity, black at the
bottom, on the sides of which the tubercles are flat and
without a bristle. From its base on each side a spiniform
process emerges, forming a right angle with it.
These processes seem the antagonists of those mentioned
above<a name="FNanchor_1336_1336" id="FNanchor_1336_1336"></a><a href="#Footnote_1336_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a>, that emerge from the <i>labium</i>. The posterior or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
inner piece has on each side a roundish space, attached
to the under surface of the two sides of the <i>rhinarium</i>,
beset also with bristle-bearing tubercles. You will find
something similar lining the <i>labrum</i> and <i>nasus</i> of some
<i>Coleoptera</i>,&mdash;say <i>Geotrupes</i>, <i>Necrophorus</i>, and <i>Dytiscus</i>.
The first piece I regard as the analogue of the palate, and
the second as connected with the sense of <i>smelling</i>. In
<i>Necrophorus</i> the circular pieces are covered with a finely
striated membrane, and in <i>Dytiscus</i> each has a little
nipple.</p>

<p>8. <i>Pharynx</i><a name="FNanchor_1337_1337" id="FNanchor_1337_1337"></a><a href="#Footnote_1337_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a>.&mdash;On the upper side of the tongue, usually
at its base or root, is the <i>pharynx</i>, or aperture by
which the food passes from the mouth to the <i>&#339;sophagus</i>.
This orifice, which is situated with respect to the tongue
of the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Libellulina</i> nearly as in those insects
(at least as far as I have been able to examine them),
whose tongue is called a <i>ligula</i> or <i>labium</i>,&mdash;of course exists
in all the mandibulate Orders whose mouth we are
now considering. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> it is covered by a
valve, the <i>Epipharynx</i> of Savigny; and it appeared to me
to be so likewise in one of the <i>HarpalidÃ¦</i> that I examined.
The formation seems different in <i>Geotrupes</i>, as far as I
can get an idea of it; but it is so difficult to examine the
interior of the mouth without laceration of some of the
parts, that I can only tell you what the appearances were
in one instance, upon removing the <i>labrum</i> from the <i>mandibles</i>;
and in another, separating the whole apparatus
of the <i>labium</i>, including the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>, from the <i>mandibles</i>
and <i>labrum</i>. In the former case, the mandibles coincided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
at the base, the two molary plates (<i>molÃ¦</i>), which in this
genus are narrow, transverse and not furrowed, are so
applied as evidently to have an action upon each other,
as the mandible opens and shuts, proper for trituration.
Within these is the base of the tongue, under the form
of a ventricose sack. The upper part of this last organ,
which forms the internal covering of the labium, appears
to consist of three (in the recent insect <i>fleshy</i>) lobes, the
middle one being bent downwards internally, so as to
form a kind of sloping cover to an orifice in the part
I call the base. After two or three days, the tongue
shrinks and dries to a hard substance;&mdash;between the mandibles
and the base of the tongue I could not discover
the <i>pharynx</i>. The above apparent opening covered by the
tongue was the only one I could perceive. In the latter
case, the form and structure of the base of the tongue is
more visible: it is an oblong ventricose tubular sack,
projecting above anteriorly into an acute angle formed
by a fine white membrane, most beautifully and delicately
striated with oblique striÃ¦, to be seen only under
a powerful lens: on the anterior side of this sack are two
parallel cartilaginous ridges close to each other, fringed
with short hairs, which take their origin from the angle.
I could not be certain whether the orifice covered by
the intermediate lobe was only apparent, or real; but I
did not succeed in my endeavour to find any other <i>pharynx</i>,
though from the molary structure of the base of
the mandibles one may conjecture that there must be one
situated at the base of this sack to receive the food they
render after trituration. The excrement of this animal
is not fluid. In the <i>Libellulina</i> the <i>pharynx</i> seems
closed by two valves meeting. This part in <i>Hymenoptera</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
and probably in other Orders, has the aspect of
being cartilaginous and fitted to sustain the action of the
substances that have to pass through it<a name="FNanchor_1338_1338" id="FNanchor_1338_1338"></a><a href="#Footnote_1338_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Epipharynx</i> is a valve, called by M. Latreille
<i>sublabrum</i> (<i>sous labre</i><a name="FNanchor_1339_1339" id="FNanchor_1339_1339"></a><a href="#Footnote_1339_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a>), attached by its base to the upper
margin of the <i>pharynx</i>, or that next the <i>labrum</i>. In
the bees it is said by Reaumur to be of a fleshy substance,
and capable of changing its figure. He seems to think
it the real <i>tongue</i> of the bee<a name="FNanchor_1340_1340" id="FNanchor_1340_1340"></a><a href="#Footnote_1340_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a>; but as it does not appear
to have any of the uses of a tongue, and merely closes
the orifice of the mouth, it surely does not merit that
name. M. Savigny calls it a membranous appendage
which exactly closes the <i>pharynx</i><a name="FNanchor_1341_1341" id="FNanchor_1341_1341"></a><a href="#Footnote_1341_1341" class="fnanchor">[1341]</a>. De Geer has examined
the <i>epipharynx</i> of the wasp, which he describes as
of a scaly substance, and regards merely as the cover of
the part just named<a name="FNanchor_1342_1342" id="FNanchor_1342_1342"></a><a href="#Footnote_1342_1342" class="fnanchor">[1342]</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>Hypopharynx</i>, which Latreille considers
as a support and appendage of the <i>epipharynx</i>, I
have little to add to the definition I have given of it above.
In the <i>Libellulina</i> the base of the tongue terminates
towards the <i>pharynx</i> in a fleshy cushion, armed at each
angle next to that part with a short hard horn or tooth
of a black colour. This cushion, I suppose, may be analogous
to the <i>hypopharynx</i> of M. Savigny<a name="FNanchor_1343_1343" id="FNanchor_1343_1343"></a><a href="#Footnote_1343_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a>. On the opposite
side the pharynx is closed by another fleshy cushion
(<i>epipharynx?</i>), which appears to line the nose, behind
those two mammillÃ¦ before described<a name="FNanchor_1344_1344" id="FNanchor_1344_1344"></a><a href="#Footnote_1344_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a>, which form the
internal covering of the <i>rhinarium</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>Before I call your attention to what I would denominate
an <i>imperfect mouth</i>, in which some one or more of
the seven organs above enumerated exist under another
form, or only as rudiments,&mdash;I must say something upon
the mouth of the <i>Myriapods</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>, in which
there seem to be <i>redundant</i> organs of manducation.&mdash;M.
Latreille, in the Essay lately quoted, in which,
though some of his notions seem fanciful, he has shown
a vast depth and range of thought and research, has asserted,&mdash;from
the admirable and curious observations of
M. Savigny, and those which since their publication he
has made himself,&mdash;that the masticating organs of <i>annulose</i>
animals (called by him <i>condylopes</i>) are a kind of
<i>legs</i><a name="FNanchor_1345_1345" id="FNanchor_1345_1345"></a><a href="#Footnote_1345_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a>. And M. Savigny, whose indefatigable labours
and unparalleled acuteness have opened the door to a
new and vast field in what may be denominated analogical
anatomy,&mdash;has observed, that with certain <i>Apiropods</i><a name="FNanchor_1346_1346" id="FNanchor_1346_1346"></a><a href="#Footnote_1346_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a>
the organs that serve for manducation do not differ
essentially from those which, with the other <i>Apiropods</i>
and the <i>Hexapods</i>, serve for <i>locomotion</i><a name="FNanchor_1347_1347" id="FNanchor_1347_1347"></a><a href="#Footnote_1347_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a>: and the
unguiform mandibles of the larvÃ¦ of certain <i>Diptera</i>,
you have before been told, are used not only in manducation,
but also as legs<a name="FNanchor_1348_1348" id="FNanchor_1348_1348"></a><a href="#Footnote_1348_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>. These remarks will satisfactorily
prove to you, that organs which at first sight possess
no visible affinity or analogy&mdash;as for instance, jaws
and legs&mdash;may, if traced through a long series of beings,
exhibit a very great one;&mdash;and will lessen your surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
when you find, that in certain tribes such commutations
of organs and their use take place.</p>

<p>The following is the structure, as to its organs, of the
mouth of the myriapods, as exhibited by the centipedes
(<i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i>). The part which appears to perform the
office of the upper lip (but which M. Savigny regards
as the nose, calling it the <i>chaperon</i>,) is a transverse piece
with a deep anterior sinus, in the centre of which is a
minute tooth<a name="FNanchor_1349_1349" id="FNanchor_1349_1349"></a><a href="#Footnote_1349_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a>. This piece is separated from the forepart
of the head by a suture; but it probably is not moveable:
however, it covers the mouth, and may be regarded
rather as analogous to the <i>labrum</i>. Below this are two
mandibles, armed at their end with five sharp triangular
teeth<a name="FNanchor_1350_1350" id="FNanchor_1350_1350"></a><a href="#Footnote_1350_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a>, under which are the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>, terminating in a
moveable concavo-convex lobe, resembling the valve of
a bivalve shell<a name="FNanchor_1351_1351" id="FNanchor_1351_1351"></a><a href="#Footnote_1351_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a>; and between them is the <i>labium</i>, of a
rhomboidal shape, divisible into two lobes, attached laterally
to the maxillÃ¦: these lobes M. Savigny terms the
<i>second maxillÃ¦</i>, forming with the others, according to
him, the <i>labium</i><a name="FNanchor_1352_1352" id="FNanchor_1352_1352"></a><a href="#Footnote_1352_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a>. Affixed to the base of this labium, or
covering it on the outside, are a pair of pediform palpi,
which he considers as the first auxiliary <i>labium</i>, and representative
of the first pair of legs of hexapods and <i>Iuli</i><a name="FNanchor_1353_1353" id="FNanchor_1353_1353"></a><a href="#Footnote_1353_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a>.
I imagine them to be also the analogues, in some degree,
of the labial palpi of a perfect mouth. The last of the
organs in question is a large rhomboidal plate affixed to
the first apparent segment of the trunk, crowned at its
vertex with two truncated denticulated teeth, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
the upper sides of which emerge a pair of moveable organs
terminating in a powerful incurved claw, and which
entirely covers all the other parts of the mouth<a name="FNanchor_1354_1354" id="FNanchor_1354_1354"></a><a href="#Footnote_1354_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a>. This,
M. Savigny deems as a <i>second</i> auxiliary <i>labium</i>, and the lateral
organs of prehension,&mdash;which may be regarded each
as a kind of maxillary hand, and as the only representatives
in this tribe of the maxillary palpi, though widely
different,&mdash;he looks upon as really analogous to the <i>second</i>
pair of legs in <i>Iulus</i> and the hexapods<a name="FNanchor_1355_1355" id="FNanchor_1355_1355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1355_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a>. These two pairs
of pedipalpes (to use an expressive French term) show
their relation to legs by their general structure, and their
analogy with palpi by their use as <i>oral</i> organs, though
belonging to the <i>trunk</i>: so that here we see the <i>legs</i> and
their appendages assume a material function in <i>manducation</i>,
forming a singular contrast to what we had observed
before with regard to <i>mandibles</i> becoming instruments
of <i>locomotion</i>. The mouth of the <i>IulidÃ¦</i>, with little
variation, is upon the same plan<a name="FNanchor_1356_1356" id="FNanchor_1356_1356"></a><a href="#Footnote_1356_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> with those here described.</p>

<p>The next type of form with regard to the oral organs
is that of the <i>Arachnida</i>. In these, as you know, the
head is confounded with the trunk; so that they are a
kind of Blemmyes in the insect world. Their organs of
manducation, amongst which there is no <i>labrum</i> or upper
lip, are, in the first place, a pair of mandibles planted
close and parallel to each other in the anterior part of
the head, which they terminate. In the spiders they consist
of two tubular joints, of which the first is much the
largest, more or less conical or cylindrical, and armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
underneath with a double row of stout teeth; and the
terminal one is more solid and harder, in the form of a
very sharp crooked claw, which in inaction is folded on
the first joint between the teeth. Under its extremity on
the outside is a minute orifice, destined to transmit a venomous
fluid, which is conducted there by an internal
canal from the base of the first joint, where is the poison-bag<a name="FNanchor_1357_1357" id="FNanchor_1357_1357"></a><a href="#Footnote_1357_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a>.
In the scorpion and harvest-man (<i>Phalangium</i>)
the mandible consists of two joints terminated by a <i>chela</i>
or double claw, the exterior one being moveable<a name="FNanchor_1358_1358" id="FNanchor_1358_1358"></a><a href="#Footnote_1358_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a>.&mdash;M.
Latreille, as has been before observed, regards these
not as representatives of the mandibles of hexapods, but
as replacing the interior pair of antennÃ¦, in the situation
of which they are precisely placed, of the <i>Crustacea</i><a name="FNanchor_1359_1359" id="FNanchor_1359_1359"></a><a href="#Footnote_1359_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a>:
and M. Savigny is of opinion that the <i>Arachnida</i> may in
some sort be defined as <i>Crustacea</i> without a head, and
with twelve legs, of which the two first pair are converted
into <i>mandibles</i> and <i>maxillÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1360_1360" id="FNanchor_1360_1360"></a><a href="#Footnote_1360_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a>. From the <i>situation</i> of the
organs in question, the first of these opinions seems preferable;
but the conversion of the legs in other cases, at
least the <i>coxÃ¦</i>, into organs of manducation, gives some
weight to the last. With regard to their <i>use</i>, it is said
to be to retain the insect which the animal has seized,
and to facilitate the compression which the maxillÃ¦ exercise
upon it for the extraction of the nutritive matter<a name="FNanchor_1361_1361" id="FNanchor_1361_1361"></a><a href="#Footnote_1361_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a>.
If this be correct, <i>in this respect</i> the mandibles may be
said to represent the <i>maxillÃ¦</i> of the mandibulate hexapods;
and, <i>vice versa</i>, the <i>sciatic</i> maxillÃ¦, as they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
been denominated<a name="FNanchor_1362_1362" id="FNanchor_1362_1362"></a><a href="#Footnote_1362_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a>, of the <i>Arachnida</i>, their mandibles.
The palpi are pediform, and the first joint of the <i>coxa</i>,
or hip, acts the part of a <i>maxilla</i>:&mdash;this is composed of
a single piece or plate, more or less oval or triangular,
sometimes straight and sometimes inclined to the <i>labium</i>,
with the interior extremity very hairy. The <i>labium</i> consists
also of a single piece, and is only an appendage of
the anterior extremity of the breast. The interior of
the mouth, or palate, presents a fleshy, hairy, linguiform
piece, which is usually applied to the internal face of the
<i>labium</i>. An opening is supposed to exist in its sides, for
the transmission of the alimentary juices<a name="FNanchor_1363_1363" id="FNanchor_1363_1363"></a><a href="#Footnote_1363_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a>. If you examine
the under side of the body of a scorpion, you will
find that not only the palpi, but the two anterior pair of
legs, by means of their <i>coxÃ¦</i>, are concerned in manducation:
so that these insects have in fact <i>three</i> pairs of
maxillÃ¦&mdash;a circumstance that M. Savigny has observed
to take place also in the harvest-men (<i>Phalangium</i> L.)<a name="FNanchor_1364_1364" id="FNanchor_1364_1364"></a><a href="#Footnote_1364_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a>.
The <i>palpi</i> of the scorpion, which may be called its <i>hands</i>,
like the anterior legs of the lobster and crab, terminate
in a tremendous <i>chela</i> or forceps, consisting of a large
triangular joint, armed at the end with a double claw
internally toothed; the <i>exterior</i> one of which, contrary
to what takes place in the animals just named, is moveable,
and not the <i>interior</i><a name="FNanchor_1365_1365" id="FNanchor_1365_1365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1365_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having given you this full account of the <i>trophi</i> of
those animals that have all the organs of manducation
developed, I must next advert to those in which one part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
receives an increment at the expense of others, and the
whole oral machine is fitted for <i>suction</i>; or where some
parts appear to be deficient, so that this may be called
an <i>imperfect</i> mouth. At first sight one would regard the
trophi of a <i>bee</i> as of this description; but this is not the
case, since it has all the ordinary organs, though the
tongue is unusually long, and looks as if it was made for
suction; which, however, as you have been informed, is
not the case.</p>

<p>There are <i>five</i> kinds of <i>imperfect</i> mouth to be met
with in insects that take their food by suction, each of
which I shall distinguish by a separate denomination.
The first is that of the <i>Hemiptera</i> Order:&mdash;this I term
the <i>Promuscis</i>; the second is that of the <i>Diptera</i>, which
with LinnÃ© I call <i>Proboscis</i>; the third, peculiar to the
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, is with me an <i>Antlia</i>; the fourth, which I
name <i>Rostrulum</i>, is confined to the <i>Aphaniptera</i> order,
or genus <i>Pulex</i> L.; and the last is <i>Rostellum</i>, which I
employ to denote the suctory organs of the louse tribe
(<i>PediculidÃ¦</i>).</p>


<p>i. <i>Promuscis</i><a name="FNanchor_1366_1366" id="FNanchor_1366_1366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1366_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a>.&mdash;The organ we are first to consider
has usually been denominated <i>Rostrum</i>: but since that
term is likewise in general use for the snout of insects of
the weevil tribes (<i>Curculio</i> L.), I think you will concur
with me in adopting the one here proposed, for the very
different oral instruments of the <i>Hemiptera</i>. Illiger has
employed <i>promuscis</i> to denote those of <i>bees</i><a name="FNanchor_1367_1367" id="FNanchor_1367_1367"></a><a href="#Footnote_1367_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a>: but since, as
I have just observed, they consist of all the ordinary organs,
they seem to require no separate denomination:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
the term, therefore, may be applied to represent a different
set of <i>trophi</i>, without any risk of producing confusion.
This part consists of <i>five</i> pieces: viz. a minute,
long, conical piece, commonly very slender, which covers
the base of the <i>promuscis</i>, and represents the <i>labrum</i><a name="FNanchor_1368_1368" id="FNanchor_1368_1368"></a><a href="#Footnote_1368_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a>; a
jointed sheath (<i>vagina</i>), consisting of either three or four
joints, the analogue of the <i>labium</i>, and four slender rigid
lancets (<i>scalpella</i>), the two exterior ones, according to
M. Savigny, representing the <i>mandibles</i>, and the intermediate
pair the <i>maxillÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1369_1369" id="FNanchor_1369_1369"></a><a href="#Footnote_1369_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a>. By the union of these four
pieces a suctorious tube is formed, which the animal inserts
into the substance, whether animal or vegetable,
the juices of which form its nutriment. These pieces are
dilated at their base, and serrated at their apex; and the
two central ones, though at their origin they are asunder,
form one tube, which has often been mistaken for a
single piece. A <i>pharynx</i> and <i>tongue</i> have been discovered
by M. Savigny in this apparatus; who thinks that
in <i>Nepa</i> there are also rudiments, but very indistinct, of
<i>labial palpi</i>: so that the <i>maxillary palpi</i> seem to be the
only part absolutely wanting<a name="FNanchor_1370_1370" id="FNanchor_1370_1370"></a><a href="#Footnote_1370_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Promuscis</i> when at rest is usually laid between
the legs; but when employed, in most cases its direction
is outward. In the genus <i>Chermes</i> L. (<i>Psylla</i> Latr.) the
origin of the <i>promuscis</i> has been supposed to be in the
<i>breast</i>; but if closely examined, this anomaly in nature
will be found not to exist. If you take one of these insects,
the first thing that strikes you upon inspecting the
head, is a pair of remarkable conical processes into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
the front appears to be divided. Look below these, and
you will there discover the upper-lip: and from this you
may follow the <i>promuscis</i> till it gets beyond the forelegs,
when it takes a direction perpendicular to the body<a name="FNanchor_1371_1371" id="FNanchor_1371_1371"></a><a href="#Footnote_1371_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a>; a
circumstance which has given rise to the above false notion.
Though in <i>Coccus</i>, <i>Chermes</i>, &amp;c. this instrument is
short, in some <i>Aphides</i> it is longer in proportion than in
any other insect. In <i>A. Quercus</i> it is three times the
length of the body; so that when folded, it stretches out
beyond it, and looks like a long tail<a name="FNanchor_1372_1372" id="FNanchor_1372_1372"></a><a href="#Footnote_1372_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a>; and in <i>A. Abietis</i>
it even exceeds that length<a name="FNanchor_1373_1373" id="FNanchor_1373_1373"></a><a href="#Footnote_1373_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a>.</p>


<p>ii. <i>Proboscis</i><a name="FNanchor_1374_1374" id="FNanchor_1374_1374"></a><a href="#Footnote_1374_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a>.&mdash;LinnÃ© long since, and after him Fabricius,
has employed this term to designate the oral instruments,
or rather their sheath, in the <i>MuscidÃ¦</i> and
some others, calling the same organ, when without fleshy
lips, <i>rostrum</i> and <i>haustellum</i>: but as the parts of the
mouth in all true <i>Diptera</i> (for <i>Hippobosca</i> and its affinities
can scarcely be deemed as co-ordinate with the rest), are
analogous to each other; although in some they are stiff
and rigid, in others flexile and soft, and in <i>&#338;strus</i> (except
the palpi) mere rudiments,&mdash;the same appellation
ought to designate them all. I am happy to find that
M. Latreille agrees with me in this opinion; and to his
sensible observations on this head, if you wish for further
information, I refer you<a name="FNanchor_1375_1375" id="FNanchor_1375_1375"></a><a href="#Footnote_1375_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a>. The mouth of Dipterous insects
appears to vary in the number of pieces that it presents;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
but in all, the <i>theca</i> or sheath is present, which represents
the <i>labium</i> (including the <i>mentum</i>) of the mandibulate
Orders<a name="FNanchor_1376_1376" id="FNanchor_1376_1376"></a><a href="#Footnote_1376_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a>. It consists of <i>three</i> joints, the last of
which is formed by the liplets (<i>Labella</i>). Those in the
<i>MuscidÃ¦</i> are large, turgid, vesiculose, and capable of
dilatation; in the <i>BombylidÃ¦</i> and other tribes they are
small, slender, long and leathery, and sometimes recurved.
The second joint or stalk, which may be said
to represent the <i>mentum</i>, the liplets being properly in a
restricted sense the analogue of the <i>labium</i>, its sides being
turned up, forms a longitudinal cavity, which contains
the <i>haustellum</i>. The upper piece of this, the <i>valvula</i>, is
long, rigid, and very sharp, representing the <i>labrum</i><a name="FNanchor_1377_1377" id="FNanchor_1377_1377"></a><a href="#Footnote_1377_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a>.
Beneath this cover, in the above cavity, are the lancets;
which, as far as they are at present known, vary in number
and form: sometimes there are <i>five</i> of them, sometimes
<i>four</i>, sometimes <i>two</i>, and sometimes, it should seem,
only <i>one</i><a name="FNanchor_1378_1378" id="FNanchor_1378_1378"></a><a href="#Footnote_1378_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a>. In the gnat (<i>Culex</i>) they are finer than a
hair, very sharp, and barbed occasionally on one side<a name="FNanchor_1379_1379" id="FNanchor_1379_1379"></a><a href="#Footnote_1379_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a>;
in the horse-fly (<i>Tabanus</i> L.) they are flat and sharp like
the blade of a knife or lancet<a name="FNanchor_1380_1380" id="FNanchor_1380_1380"></a><a href="#Footnote_1380_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a>. In this tribe the upper
pair, or the knives (<i>Cultelli</i>), represent the <i>mandibles</i>;
the lower pair, or the lancets (<i>Scalpella</i>), usually palpigerous,
the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>; and the central one the <i>tongue</i>. In
the horse-fly Reaumur has figured only <i>four</i>, exclusive
of the <i>labrum</i> and <i>labium</i>; but in a specimen I have preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
there appear to be <i>five</i>, one of which, as slender
as a hair, I regard as the analogue of the tongue<a name="FNanchor_1381_1381" id="FNanchor_1381_1381"></a><a href="#Footnote_1381_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a>.&mdash;When
the lancets are reduced to two, they probably represent
the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>, the mandibles being absorbed in
the <i>labrum</i>; and where there is only one, the maxillÃ¦
also are absorbed by the <i>labium</i>, which then bears the
palpi, the lancet representing the tongue<a name="FNanchor_1382_1382" id="FNanchor_1382_1382"></a><a href="#Footnote_1382_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a>. The lancets
are so constructed in many cases, as to be able by their
union to form a tube proper for suction, or rather for
forcing the fluid by the pressure of the lower parts to the
<i>pharynx</i><a name="FNanchor_1383_1383" id="FNanchor_1383_1383"></a><a href="#Footnote_1383_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a>. <i>Labial palpi</i> appear not usually present in
the <i>proboscis</i>; but M. Savigny thinks he has discovered
vestiges of them in <i>Tabanus</i><a name="FNanchor_1384_1384" id="FNanchor_1384_1384"></a><a href="#Footnote_1384_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a>. In this genus the maxillary
ones are large, and consist of <i>two</i> joints<a name="FNanchor_1385_1385" id="FNanchor_1385_1385"></a><a href="#Footnote_1385_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a>. The proboscis
is often so folded, as to form two elbows; the base
forming an angle with the stalk, and the latter with the
lips, so as in shape to represent the letter Z, only that the
upper angle points to the breast, and the lower one to
the mouth: this is the case with the flesh-fly and many
others. In other flies, as <i>Conops</i> and <i>Stomoxys</i>, whose
punctures on our legs so torment us<a name="FNanchor_1386_1386" id="FNanchor_1386_1386"></a><a href="#Footnote_1386_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a>, there is only a
single fold, with its angle to the breast. The <i>proboscis</i> is
received in a large oblong cavity of the underside of the
anterior part of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>It may here be observed, that in the <i>promuscis</i> the
elongation of the organs seems to be made chiefly at the
expense of <i>all</i> the palpi, but in the <i>proboscis</i> at that of
the <i>labial</i> only; and in some cases at that also of the
<i>mandibles</i> or <i>maxillÃ¦</i>;&mdash;the former merging in the <i>labrum</i>
and the latter in the <i>labium</i>.</p>


<p>iii. <i>Antlia</i><a name="FNanchor_1387_1387" id="FNanchor_1387_1387"></a><a href="#Footnote_1387_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a>.&mdash;The <i>third</i> kind of imperfect mouth is that
of the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, which I have called <i>Antlia</i>. Fabricius
denominates it <i>lingua</i>: but as this organ has no analogy
with the real tongue of insects, this is confessedly
improper, and it appeared necessary therefore to exchange
it for another denomination: I have endeavoured to apply
a term to it that indicates its use&mdash;to pump up, namely,
the nectar of the flowers into the mouth of the insect.
On a former occasion I described to you the structure of
this instrument<a name="FNanchor_1388_1388" id="FNanchor_1388_1388"></a><a href="#Footnote_1388_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a>; but further discoveries with regard to
it having since been made by MM. Savigny and Latreille,
I shall here give you the result of their observations.
The former of these able physiologists has detected
in the mouth of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> rudiments of almost
all the parts of a perfect mouth. Of the correctness
of this assertion you may satisfy yourself, if you consult
his admirable elucidatory plates, and compare them
with the insects. Just above the origin of the spiral
tongue or pump, the head is a little prominent and
rounded; and immediately below the middle of this prominence
there is a very minute, membranous, triangular
or semicircular piece; which from its position, as covering
the base of the <i>antlia</i>, may be regarded as the rudiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
of the <i>upper-lip</i> (<i>labrum</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1389_1389" id="FNanchor_1389_1389"></a><a href="#Footnote_1389_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a>. On each side of the
outer base of the <i>antlia</i> is another small immoveable
piece, resembling a flattened tubercle, the end of which
is internally hairy or scaly: these pieces appear to represent
the <i>mandibles</i><a name="FNanchor_1390_1390" id="FNanchor_1390_1390"></a><a href="#Footnote_1390_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a>. Near the base of each half of the
<i>antlia</i>, just below a sinus, may be distinctly seen the minute,
usually biarticulate rudiment of a <i>maxillary palpus</i><a name="FNanchor_1391_1391" id="FNanchor_1391_1391"></a><a href="#Footnote_1391_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a>;
demonstrating to a certainty that these spiral organs,
at least their lateral tubes or <i>Solenaria</i>, are real
maxillÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_1392_1392" id="FNanchor_1392_1392"></a><a href="#Footnote_1392_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a>. The rudiment of the <i>under-lip</i> (<i>Labium</i>) is
the almost horny triangular piece united by membrane
to the two stalks of the maxillÃ¦, and supporting at its
base the recurved labial palpi; which are so well known
that I need not enlarge upon them<a name="FNanchor_1393_1393" id="FNanchor_1393_1393"></a><a href="#Footnote_1393_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a>. Amongst these
parts there seems at first sight no representative of the
<i>tongue</i>; but M. Latreille has advanced some very ingenious,
and I think satisfactory arguments<a name="FNanchor_1394_1394" id="FNanchor_1394_1394"></a><a href="#Footnote_1394_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a>, which go to
prove that this part, at least the tongue of <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
has its analogue in the intermediate tube or <i>Fistula</i>
formed by the union of the two maxillÃ¦, and which conveys
the fluid aliment of this Order to the <i>pharynx</i>. As
in <i>Diptera</i> the <i>maxillÃ¦</i> sometimes merge in the <i>labium</i>,
so here the <i>tongue</i> (as it were divided longitudinally)
merges in the <i>maxillÃ¦</i>. He further observes, that in a
transverse section of the maxilla of the death's-head
hawk-moth (<i>Sphinx Atropos</i>), the lateral tube appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
to be divided into two by a membranous partition, and
to contain in the upper cavity a small cylindrical tube,
which seemed to be a <i>trachea</i><a name="FNanchor_1395_1395" id="FNanchor_1395_1395"></a><a href="#Footnote_1395_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a>. To animals that are
without lungs, and breathe by <i>tracheÃ¦</i>, suction must be
performed in a very different way from what it is by
those that breathe by the <i>mouth</i>: and as in the very extended
organs in question the fluid has a long space to
pass before it reaches the <i>pharynx</i>, in some way or other
these lateral tubes may have the power of producing a
vacuum in the middle tube, and so facilitate its passage
thither. We see, in the <i>antlia</i>, that the maxillÃ¦ receive
their vast elongation at the expense of all the other organs,
except the <i>labial palpi</i>.</p>


<p>iv. <i>Rostrulum</i><a name="FNanchor_1396_1396" id="FNanchor_1396_1396"></a><a href="#Footnote_1396_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a>.&mdash;An animal very annoying to us affords
the type of the next kind of imperfect mouth&mdash;I
mean the <i>flea</i>. Its oral apparatus, which I would name
<i>rostrulum</i>, appears to consist of <i>seven</i> pieces. First are a
pair of triangular organs, the <i>laminÃ¦</i>, which together
somewhat resemble the beak of a bird, and are affixed,
one on each side of the mouth, under the antennÃ¦: these
represent the <i>mandibles</i> of a perfect mouth<a name="FNanchor_1397_1397" id="FNanchor_1397_1397"></a><a href="#Footnote_1397_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a>. Next, a
pair of long sharp lancets (<i>Scalpella</i>), which emerge from
the head below the laminÃ¦: these are analogous to <i>maxillÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1398_1398" id="FNanchor_1398_1398"></a><a href="#Footnote_1398_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a>:
a pair of palpi, consisting of four joints, are attached
to these near their base<a name="FNanchor_1399_1399" id="FNanchor_1399_1399"></a><a href="#Footnote_1399_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a>, which of course are
<i>maxillary palpi</i>. And lastly, in the midst of all is a
slender setiform organ (<i>ligula</i>), which is the counterpart
of the <i>tongue</i><a name="FNanchor_1400_1400" id="FNanchor_1400_1400"></a><a href="#Footnote_1400_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a>. RÃ¶sel, and after him Latreille, seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
have overlooked this last piece, since they reckon only
<i>six</i> pieces in the flea's mouth<a name="FNanchor_1401_1401" id="FNanchor_1401_1401"></a><a href="#Footnote_1401_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a>: but the hand and eye of
our friend Curtis have detected a <i>seventh</i>, as you see in
his figure. From this account it appears, that the elongation
of the organs of the <i>Aphaniptera</i> Order is at the
expense of the <i>labium</i> and its <i>palpi</i>.</p>


<p>v. <i>Rostellum.</i>&mdash;So little is known of the composition
of the next kind of imperfect mouth, that I need not enlarge
upon it. It is peculiar to the louse tribe (<i>PediculidÃ¦</i>),
and it consists of the tubulet (<i>Tubulus</i>), and siphuncle
(<i>Siphunculus</i>). The former is slenderer in the
middle than at the base and apex, the latter being turgid,
rather spherical, and armed with claws which probably
lay hold of the skin while the animal is engaged in
suction. When not used, the whole machine is withdrawn
within the head; the siphuncle, which is the suctorious
part, being first retracted within the tubulet, in
the same way as a snail retracts its <i>tentacula</i><a name="FNanchor_1402_1402" id="FNanchor_1402_1402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1402_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a>. This apparatus
seems formed at the expense of all the other
organs.</p>

<p>There are some other kinds of imperfect mouth,
which, though they seem not to merit each a distinct
denomination, should not be passed altogether without
notice. The first I shall mention is that of the family of
<i>Pupipara</i> Latr. (<i>Hippobosca</i> L.). It consists of a pair
of hairy coriaceous valves, which include a very slender
rigid tube or siphuncle, the instrument of suction, which
Latreille describes as formed by the union of two setiform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
pieces<a name="FNanchor_1403_1403" id="FNanchor_1403_1403"></a><a href="#Footnote_1403_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a>. In <i>Melophagus</i>, the sheep-louse, the union
of the valves of the sheath is so short, that they appear
like a tube; but if cut off they will separate, and show
the siphuncle, as fine as a hair, between them. This organ
is of a type so dissimilar, as was before observed, to
that of the <i>Diptera</i> in general, and approaches so near to
that of the dog-tick (<i>Ixodes</i>), that they may be deemed rather
apterous insects with two wings, than to belong to that
Order; and the circumstance that some of the family are
apterous confirms this idea. In fact they are a <i>transition</i>
family that connects the two Orders, but are nearest to
the <i>Aptera</i>. In <i>Nycteribia</i> the oral organs differ from
those of the other <i>Pupipara</i> in having <i>palpi</i>. This also
is the case with those of the genus <i>Ixodes</i>, the palpi of
which are placed upon the same base with the instrument
of suction, than which they are longer: they appear
to consist of <i>two</i> joints, the last very long and flat.
The instrument of suction itself is formed by three hard
rigid laminÃ¦; two shorter parallel ones above, that cover
the third, which is longer and broader, and armed
on each side with several teeth like a saw, having their
points towards the base<a name="FNanchor_1404_1404" id="FNanchor_1404_1404"></a><a href="#Footnote_1404_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a>. Many of the other <i>Acari</i> L.
have mandibles, and several have not: but their oral organs
have not yet been sufficiently examined; and from
the extreme minuteness of most of them, this is no easy
task; nor to ascertain in what points they differ or
agree.</p>

<p>If you consider the general plan of the organs of manducation
in the vertebrate animals, how few are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
variations that it admits! An upper and a lower jaw
planted with teeth, or a beak consisting of an upper or
a lower mandible with a central tongue, form its principal
features. But in the little world of insects, how wonderful
and infinite is the diversity which, as you see, in
this respect they exhibit! Consider the number of the
organs, the varying forms of each in the different tribes,
adjusted for nice variations in their uses:&mdash;how gradual,
too, the transition from one to another! how one set
of instruments is adapted to prepare the food for deglutition
by mastication; another merely to lacerate it, so
that its juices can be expressed; a third to lap a fluid
aliment; a fourth to imbibe it by suction&mdash;and you will
see and acknowledge in all the hand of an almighty and
all-bountiful <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, and glorify his wisdom, power,
and goodness, so conspicuously manifested in the structure
of the meanest of his creatures. You will see also,
that all things are created after a pre-conceived plan; in
which there is a regular and measured transition from
one form to another, not only with respect to beings themselves,
but also to their organs&mdash;no new organ being produced
without a gradual approach to it; so that scarcely
any change takes place that is violent and unexpected,
and for which the way is not prepared by intermediate
gradations. And when you further consider, that every
being, with its every organ, is exactly fitted for its functions;
and that every being has an office assigned, upon
the due execution of which the welfare, in certain respects,
of this whole system depends, you will clearly
perceive that this whole plan, intire in all its parts, must
have been coeval with the Creation; and that all the
species,&mdash;subject to those variations only that climate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
and different food produce,&mdash;have remained essentially
the same, or they would not have answered the end for
which they were made, from that time to this.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having given you this particular account of the <i>trophi</i>
or organs of the mouth of insects, I must now make some
observations upon the <i>other</i> parts of the head. I have
divided it, as you see in the Table, into <i>face</i> and <i>subface</i>;
the former including its <i>upper</i> and the latter its <i>lower</i>
surface. Strictly speaking, some parts of the face, as the
temples and cheeks, are common to both surfaces; but
I do not therefore reckon them as belonging to the subface,
which, exclusive of the mouth and its organs, consists
only of the <i>throat</i>, and where there is a neck, the
<i>gula</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Nasus</i><a name="FNanchor_1405_1405" id="FNanchor_1405_1405"></a><a href="#Footnote_1405_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a>.&mdash;I shall consider the parts of the face in the
order in which they stand in the Table, beginning with
the <i>nasus</i> or nose. Fabricius has denominated this part
the <i>clypeus</i>, in which he has been followed by most modern
Entomologists. You may therefore think, perhaps,
that I have here unnecessarily altered a term so generally
adopted, and expect that I assign some sufficient
reasons for such a change. I have before hinted that
there is good ground for thinking that the sense of <i>smell</i>
in insects resides somewhere in the vicinity of this part;
and when I come to treat of their senses, I shall produce
at large those arguments that have induced me to adopt
this opinion: and if I can make out this satisfactorily,
you will readily allow the propriety of the denomination.
I shall here only state those <i>secondary</i> reasons for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
term, which, in my idea, prove that it is much more to
the purpose than <i>clypeus</i>. This last word was originally
applied by LinnÃ© in a metaphorical sense to the ample
covering of the head of the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>, and the thoracic
shield of <i>Silpha</i>, <i>Cassida</i>, <i>Lampyris</i>, and <i>Blatta</i>: in all
which cases there was a propriety in the figurative use
of it, because of the resemblance of the parts so illustrated
to a <i>shield</i>. But when <i>Fabricius</i> (though he sometimes
employs the term, as LinnÃ© did, merely for illustration,)
admitted it into his orismological table, as a term to represent
universally the anterior part of the face of insects
to which the labrum is attached (though in some cases
he designates the <i>labrum</i> itself by this name), it became
extremely inappropriate; since in every case, except that
of the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>, the part has no pretension to be
called a <i>shield</i>;&mdash;so that the term is rather calculated to
mislead than illustrate. This impropriety seems at length
to have struck M. Latreille, since in a late essay<a name="FNanchor_1406_1406" id="FNanchor_1406_1406"></a><a href="#Footnote_1406_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> he has
changed the name of this part to <i>Epistomis</i>, a term signifying
<i>the part above the mouth</i>. But there are reasons,
exclusive of those hereafter to be produced concerning
the sense of smell, which seem to me to prove that <i>nasus</i>
is a preferable term; not to mention its claim of priority,
as having been used to signify this part a century ago<a name="FNanchor_1407_1407" id="FNanchor_1407_1407"></a><a href="#Footnote_1407_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a>.
When we come to consider the terms for the other parts
of the head, as <i>lips</i>, <i>jaws</i>, <i>tongue</i>, <i>eyes</i>, <i>temples</i>, <i>cheeks</i>,
<i>forehead</i>, &amp;c. the concinnity, if I may so speak, and harmony
of our technical language, seem to require that the
part analogous in point of situation to the <i>nose</i> of vertebrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
animals should bear the same name. And any person
who had never examined an insect before, if asked
to point out the <i>nose</i> of the animal, would immediately
cast his eye upon this part: so that one of the principal
uses of imposing names upon parts&mdash;that they might be
more readily known&mdash;would be attained. If it is objected,
that calling a part a <i>nose</i> that has not the sense of
smell, supposing it to be so, might lead to mistakes&mdash;I
would answer, that this objection is not regarded as valid
in other cases: for instance, the <i>maxillÃ¦</i> are not generally
used as <i>jaws</i>, and yet no one objects to the term;
because, from their situation, they evidently have an analogy
to the organs whose name they bear. But enough
on this subject&mdash;we will now consider the part itself.</p>

<p>To enable you to distinguish the nose of insects when
it is not separated from the rest of the face by an impressed
line, you must observe that it is the terminal middle part
that sometimes overhangs the upper-lip, and at others
is nearly in the same line with it; that on each side of it
are the cheeks, which run from the anterior half of the
eyes to the base of the mandibles. Just below the antennÃ¦
is sometimes another part distinct from the nose,
which I shall soon have to mention; so that the nose
must not be regarded as reaching always nearly to the
base or insertion of the antennÃ¦, since it sometimes occupies
only half the space between them and the upper-lip,
which space is marked out by an impressed line.
But you will not always be left at such uncertainty when
you want to ascertain the limits of the nose; for it is in
many cases a distinct piece, separated by an elevated or
impressed line from the rest of the face. This separation
is either partial or universal. Take any species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
the genera <i>Copris</i>, <i>Onitis</i>, or <i>Ateuchus</i>, and you will see
the nose marked out in the centre of the anterior part of
the face by two <i>elevated</i> lines, forming nearly a triangle
and bounded by the horn<a name="FNanchor_1408_1408" id="FNanchor_1408_1408"></a><a href="#Footnote_1408_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a>. Or take a common wasp or
hornet, and you will find a similar space, though approaching
to a quadrangular figure, marked out by <i>impressed</i>
lines<a name="FNanchor_1409_1409" id="FNanchor_1409_1409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1409_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a>. In <i>Rhagio</i> and <i>Sciara</i>, two Dipterous genera,
this impression is so deep as to look like a suture.
Between these lines, in those cases, is included what I
call the <i>nose</i>. As to <i>substance</i>, in general it does not differ
from the rest of the head; but in the <i>CleridÃ¦</i> it is
almost membranous. You must observe, that in all these,
what at first sight appears to be the termination of the
front, is not the nose, but the narrow depressed piece
that intervenes between it and the lip. With regard to
its <i>clothing</i>, it is most commonly naked, but in some genera
it is covered with hair; in <i>Crabro</i> F. often with
golden or silver pile, which imparts a singular brilliance
to the mouth of the insects of that genus: M. Latreille
supposes that the brilliant colours of the golden-wasp
(<i>Chrysis</i> L.) may dazzle their enemies, and so <i>promote</i>
their escape<a name="FNanchor_1410_1410" id="FNanchor_1410_1410"></a><a href="#Footnote_1410_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a>; the brilliance of the mouth of the <i>Crabro</i>
may on the contrary at first dazzle their prey for a
moment, so as to <i>prevent</i> their escape. The <i>form</i> of the
nose, where distinct from the rest of the face, admits of
several variations: thus in the <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i> and <i>CleridÃ¦</i>
it is transverse and linear; in <i>Copris</i> it is triangular, with
the vertex of the triangle truncated; in <i>Vespa Crabro</i> it
is subquadrate and sinuated. In many Heteromerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
beetles<a name="FNanchor_1411_1411" id="FNanchor_1411_1411"></a><a href="#Footnote_1411_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> it is rounded posteriorly: in <i>Pelecotoma</i>, a new
genus in this tribe, related to <i>Asida</i>, there is a deep anterior
sinus; in <i>Blaps</i> the anterior margin is concave;
in <i>Cetonia</i><a name="FNanchor_1412_1412" id="FNanchor_1412_1412"></a><a href="#Footnote_1412_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> <i>Brownii</i>, and <i>atropunctata</i> (forming a distinct
subgenus), it is bifid: it varies in the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>, in
some being bidentate, in others quadridentate, and in
others again sexdentate, including the cheeks: in <i>Mylabris</i>,
a kind of blister-beetle, it is transverse and nearly
oval; in <i>Lamia</i>, a capricorn-beetle, it represents a parallelogram;
and in most <i>Orthoptera</i> it is subtriangular: in <i>Tettigonia</i> F.
it is prominent, transversely furrowed, and divided
by a longitudinal channel: in <i>Otiocerus</i> K. it presents
the longitudinal section of a cone<a name="FNanchor_1413_1413" id="FNanchor_1413_1413"></a><a href="#Footnote_1413_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a>: in the <i>Diptera</i>
Order, with the exception of the <i>TipulidÃ¦</i> and some
others, in which it unites with the cheeks, &amp;c. to form a
rostrum, the nose in general, as to <i>form</i>, answers to its
name, resembling that of many of the <i>Mammalia</i>: in
some of the <i>AsilidÃ¦</i> it is very tumid at the end, and terminates
in a sinus, to permit the passage of the proboscis
to and fro: in many of the <i>SyrphidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c. it is first flat
and depressed, and then is suddenly elevated, so as to
give the animal's head the air of that of a monkey: in
some tribes, as <i>Rhingia</i>, <i>Nemotelus</i>, <i>Eristalis</i>, &amp;c., in
conjunction with the cheeks it forms a conical rostrum:
in <i>Tabanus bovinus</i>, and other horse-flies, it terminates
in three angles or teeth. Many more forms might be
mentioned, but these will suffice to give you a general
idea of them. In <i>size</i> and <i>proportions</i> the nose also varies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
It is frequently, as in <i>Tettigonia</i>, the most conspicuous
part of the face, both for size and characters; but
in the <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i> it is very small, and often scarcely
discernible, being overshadowed by its ample front: and
it may be observed in general, that when the antennÃ¦
approximate the mouth, as in this genus and many others,
the <i>front</i> becomes <i>ample</i>, and the <i>nose</i> is reduced to its
<i>minimum</i>: but when they are distant from the mouth, the
reverse takes place; and the nose is at its <i>maximum</i> and
the front at its <i>minimum</i>. <i>Mutilla</i>, <i>Myrmecodes</i>, <i>Scolia</i>, &amp;c.
in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, are an example of the former; and
the <i>PompilidÃ¦</i>, <i>SphecidÃ¦</i>, <i>VespidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c. of the latter. In
<i>Myopa buccata</i>, &amp;c. its length exceeds its width; but more
commonly the reverse takes place. The <i>circumscription</i> of
the <i>nose</i> also deserves attention. It is usually terminated
behind by the front (<i>frons</i>), or, where it exists, by the <i>postnasus</i>,
in the sides by the cheeks, and anteriorly by the <i>labrum</i>.
But this is not invariably the case; for in the <i>CimicidÃ¦</i>,
in which the cheeks form the bed of the <i>Promuscis</i>,
the front embraces it on each side by means of two lateral
processes, that sometimes meet or lap over each other
anteriorly, which gives the nose the appearance of being
insulated; but it really dips below these lobes to join the
<i>labrum</i>. This structure you may see in <i>Edessa</i> F., and
many other bugs. This part sometimes has its <i>arms</i>.
Thus in <i>Copris</i>, and many <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>, the horns of the
head seem, in part at least, to belong to this portion of
it; in <i>Tipula oleracea</i> (the crane-fly), &amp;c. it terminates
before in a horizontal mucro. In <i>Osmia cornuta</i>, a kind
of wild-bee, each side of the nose is armed with a vertical
horn. The <i>margin</i> of the nose in most Lamellicorn
insects, though mostly level, curves upwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>I am next to mention a part of the nose which merits
a distinct name and notice, which I conceive in some
sort to be analogous to the <i>nostrils</i> of quadrupeds, and
which I have therefore named the <i>Rhinarium</i> or nostril-piece.
I had originally distinguished it by the plural term
<i>nares</i>, nostrils; but as it is usually a single piece, I thought
it best to denote it by one in the singular. When I
treat of the senses of insects, I shall give you my reasons,
as I have before said, for considering this part as the
organ of scent, or connected with it, which you will then
be able to appreciate. I shall only here observe, that the
piece in question is in the usual situation of the nostrils&mdash;between
the nose and the lip. In a large number of
insects this part may be regarded as nearly obsolete;
or at least it is merely represented by the very narrow
membranous line that intervenes between the nose and
the lip and connects them; which, as in the case of the
head of <i>Harpali</i> before noticed, may be capable of tension
and relaxation, and so present a greater surface to
the action of the atmosphere. But I offer this as mere
conjecture. In the lady-bird (<i>Coccinella</i>) this line is a
little wider, and becomes a distinct <i>Rhinarium</i>; as it
does also in <i>Geotrupes</i>. With respect to its <i>insertion</i>,
the <i>rhinarium</i> is a piece that either entirely separates
the nose from the lip, or only partially: the former is
the most common structure. It is particularly remarkable
in a New Holland genus of chafers (<i>Anoplognathus</i>
Leach). In <i>A. viridiÃ¦ncus</i> it is very ample, and forms
the under side of the recurved nose, so that a large space
intervenes between the margin of the latter and the base
of the <i>labrum</i>. In <i>Macropus</i> Thunb., of the Capricorn
tribe (<i>Cerambyx</i> L.), the nostril-piece, which forms a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
distinct segment, is narrower than the nose, and the
upper-lip than the nostril-piece, forming as it were a
triple gradation from the front to the mouth. Again, in
others the part in question is received into a sinus of the
nose. This is the case with the dragon-flies (<i>Libellulina</i>),
in which this sinus is very wide; in the burying-beetle
(<i>Necrophorus</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1414_1414" id="FNanchor_1414_1414"></a><a href="#Footnote_1414_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a>, in some species of which it is deep but
narrow; and in a species of <i>Tenebrio</i> from New Holland,
which perhaps would make a subgenus. If you examine
with a common glass any of the larger rove-beetles (<i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>),
you will find that the nose itself seems lost in
the nostril-piece, both together forming a very narrow
line across the head above the <i>labrum</i>, without any apparent
distinction between them; but if you have recourse
to a higher magnifier, you will find this divided into an
upper and lower part, the former of the hard substance
of the rest of the head, and the latter membranous. I
once was of opinion that the prominent transversely furrowed
part, so conspicuous in the face of <i>Tettigonia</i> F.<a name="FNanchor_1415_1415" id="FNanchor_1415_1415"></a><a href="#Footnote_1415_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a>,
was the <i>front</i>: but upon considering the situation of this,
chiefly below the eyes and antennÃ¦, and comparing it
with the analogous piece in <i>Fulgora laternaria</i> and other
insects of the Homopterous section of the <i>Hemiptera</i>, I
incline to think that it represents the <i>nose</i>, and that the
longitudinal ridge below it is the nostril-piece<a name="FNanchor_1416_1416" id="FNanchor_1416_1416"></a><a href="#Footnote_1416_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a>. In the
Heteropterous section it is merely the vertical termination
of their narrow nose. In other insects again, this
part approaches in some measure to the common idea of
nostrils; there being <i>two</i>, either one on each side the
nose, or two approximated ones. If you catch the first
humble-bee that you see busy upon a flower, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
discover a minute membranous protuberance under each
angle of the nose. Something similar may be observed
in some species of <i>Asilus</i> L. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, especially
in <i>Blatta</i>, <i>Phasma</i>, and some <i>LocustÃ¦</i>, two roundish
or square pieces, close to each other on the lower part
of the nose, represent the nostrils<a name="FNanchor_1417_1417" id="FNanchor_1417_1417"></a><a href="#Footnote_1417_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a>.&mdash;With regard to
<i>substance</i>, in the chafer-tribes, at least those that feed
on leaves or living vegetable matter, as the <i>MelolonthidÃ¦</i>,
<i>AnoplognathidÃ¦</i>, and in many other insects, the
<i>rhinarium</i> is of the same substance with the rest of the
head; but in <i>Macropus</i> Thunb., <i>Staphylinus</i>, <i>Necrophorus</i>,
&amp;c., it consists of membrane.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Postnasus</i><a name="FNanchor_1418_1418" id="FNanchor_1418_1418"></a><a href="#Footnote_1418_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a>.&mdash;This is a part that appears to have
been confounded by Entomologists with the front of insects;
in general, indeed, it may be regarded as included
in the nose, and does not require separate notice: but
there are many cases in which it is distinctly marked out
and set by itself, and in which it forms a useful diagnostic
of genera or subgenera. There is a very splendid
and beautiful Chinese beetle, to be seen in most collections
of foreign insects (<i>Sagra purpurea</i>), in which this
part forms a striking feature, and helps to distinguish the
genus from its near neighbour <i>Donacia</i>. If you examine
its face, you will discover a triangular piece, below the
antennÃ¦ and above the <i>nasus</i>, separated from the latter
and from the front by a deeply-impressed line: this is the
<i>postnasus</i> or <i>after-nose</i>. Again: if you examine any specimens
of a Hymenopterous genus called by Fabricius
<i>Prosopis</i> (<i>HylÃ¦us</i> Latr.), remarkable for its scent of
baum, you will find a similar triangle marked out in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
similar situation<a name="FNanchor_1419_1419" id="FNanchor_1419_1419"></a><a href="#Footnote_1419_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a>. In many Coleopterous insects, besides
<i>Sagra</i>, you will discover traces of the part we are considering:
as in <i>Anthia</i>, <i>Dytiscus</i>, and several others of the
Predaceous beetles. In <i>Cistela</i> it is larger than the nose
itself; but it is more conspicuous in the <i>Orthoptera</i>, particularly
in <i>Locusta</i> (<i>Gryllus</i> F.), in which it is the space
below the antennÃ¦, distinguished by two or four rather
diverging ridges<a name="FNanchor_1420_1420" id="FNanchor_1420_1420"></a><a href="#Footnote_1420_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a>. In the <i>Libellulina</i>, <i>Myrmeleonina</i>,
&amp;c. it is a distinct transverse piece. In <i>Dasyga</i> Latr.,
a kind of bee, it is armed with a transverse ridge or horn&mdash;But
enough has been said to render you acquainted
with it; I shall therefore proceed to the next piece.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Frons</i><a name="FNanchor_1421_1421" id="FNanchor_1421_1421"></a><a href="#Footnote_1421_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a>.&mdash;The <i>Front</i> of insects may be denominated
the <i>middle</i> part of the face between the eyes,
bounded anteriorly by the nose, or after-nose, where it
exists, and the cheeks; laterally by the eyes; and posteriorly
by the vertex. Speaking properly, it is the region
of the <i>antennÃ¦</i>; though when these organs are placed
before the eyes, under the margin of the nose, as in many
Lamellicorn and Heteromerous beetles, they seem to be
rather <i>nasal</i> than <i>frontal</i>. This part is often elevated,
as in the elastic beetles (<i>Elater</i>), whose faculty of jumping,
by means of a pectoral spring, has been related to
you<a name="FNanchor_1422_1422" id="FNanchor_1422_1422"></a><a href="#Footnote_1422_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a>. In <i>Anthia</i>, a Predaceous beetle, it has often three
longitudinal ridges. In many of the Capricorn beetles
(<i>Cerambyx</i> L.), it is nearly in the shape of a Calvary
cross, with the arms forming an obtuse angle, and then
terminating at the sinus of the eyes in an elevation for
the site of the antennÃ¦. In the ants also (<i>FormicidÃ¦</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
the front is often elevated between those organs. In
<i>Ponera</i>, one tribe of them, this elevation is bilobed,
and receives between its lobes the vertex of the <i>postnasus</i>.
In the hornet (<i>Vespa Crabro</i>) the elevation is a
triangle, with its vertex towards the mouth. In <i>Sagra</i>
it is marked out into three triangles, the <i>postnasus</i> making
a fourth, with the vertexes meeting in the centre.
In the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i> and <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> the horns are often
<i>frontal</i> appendages, as is that of <i>Empusa</i> Latr., a leaf-insect,
and probably those of <i>Sphinx IatrophÃ¦</i> F., which
affords a singular instance of a horned Lepidopterous one.
Sometimes it is an ample space, reducing the nose to a
very narrow line, as in the <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, or sending
forth a lobe on each side, as before mentioned, which
embraces the nose. In a species of bug from Brazil, related
to <i>Aradus</i> F., these lobes are dilated, foliaceous,
and meet before the nose, so as to form a remarkable
extended frontlet to the head. In others this part is extremely
minute: thus in many <i>male</i> flies and other insects,
as the <i>Libellulina</i>, where the eyes touch each other,
the front is cut off from the vertex and reduced to a small
angle. In the female flies the communication with the vertex
is kept open, and the front consequently longer. In
the horse-flies (<i>TabanidÃ¦</i>), in <i>HÃ¦matopota</i>, and <i>Heptatoma</i>,
the frontal space is wider than in the rest of that
tribe. Many of these are distinguished by a levigated
area behind the antennÃ¦ in the part we are treating of.
In the <i>Libellulina</i>, and in the drone-bee, whose eyes are
confluent, the stemmata are in the front. In many <i>Orthoptera</i>
also, as <i>Locusta</i> Leach, one of them is below
the antennÃ¦; and in the lanthorn-fly tribe (<i>FulgoridÃ¦</i>),
both these organs, which are situate between them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
the eyes, as they do also in <i>Truxalis</i>, appear to be in
it<a name="FNanchor_1423_1423" id="FNanchor_1423_1423"></a><a href="#Footnote_1423_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a>. In this tribe the rostrum is an elongation of the
part in question; and perhaps you would think at first
that what I have considered as the <i>nose</i> in <i>Tettigonia</i> F.
was also a tendency to this kind of rostrum; but if you
examine the great lanthorn-fly (<i>Fulgora laternaria</i>), you
will find besides, at the lower base of the lanthorn, a triangular
piece analogous to the nose of <i>Tettigonia</i>, and
below it another representing its nostril-piece:&mdash;the horizontal
part of the nose in that genus may perhaps be regarded
as part of the front. In <i>Truxalis</i> F. the face
consists of a supine and prone surface, and the latter is
composed of the front, after-nose, nose, and organs of the
mouth. I may notice here a most remarkable and singular
tribe of bugs, of which two species have been figured
by Stoll<a name="FNanchor_1424_1424" id="FNanchor_1424_1424"></a><a href="#Footnote_1424_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a>: in these the head, or rather those parts of it that
we have now been describing, the nose, namely, the after-nose,
and front, are absolutely divided longitudinally in
two, each half having an eye and antenna planted in it;
or perhaps, as it is stated to be divided in one instance to
the commencement of the <i>promuscis</i>, the nose is left intire,
and dips down, as in cases before alluded to: so that
in this the nose appears to leave the lobes of the front,
which in others embrace its sides.</p>

<p>iv. <i>Vertex</i><a name="FNanchor_1425_1425" id="FNanchor_1425_1425"></a><a href="#Footnote_1425_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a>.&mdash;We now come to the <i>vertex</i>, or crown
of the head; which is situated behind the front, and,
except where the communication is intercepted by confluent
eyes, adjoins it. It is laterally bounded by the
hind part of the eyes and the temples; and <i>posteriorly</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
where that part exists, by the <i>occiput</i>. The vertex may
be denominated the ordinary region of the <i>stemmata</i>:
for though in several cases, as we have just seen, one or
more of them are planted in the front; yet this in the great
majority, especially in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, is their natural
station. In <i>Blatta</i> and some other <i>Orthoptera</i> the posterior
angle of the head is the vertex. In many dung-chafers
of Latreille's genus <i>Onthophagus</i>, which are said
to have <i>occipital</i> horns, as <i>O. nutans</i>, <i>nuchicornis</i>, <i>Xiphias</i>,
&amp;c., the horn really arms the part I regard as the
vertex. In <i>Locusta</i> Leach, this part is very ample, and
in <i>Truxalis</i> very long; but more generally it is small,
and not requiring particular notice.</p>

<p>v. <i>Occiput</i><a name="FNanchor_1426_1426" id="FNanchor_1426_1426"></a><a href="#Footnote_1426_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a>.&mdash;The <i>occiput</i>, or <i>hind-head</i>, is that part
of the face that either forms an angle with the vertex
posteriorly, or slopes downwards from it. It has for its
lateral boundaries the temples, and behind it is either
terminated by the orifice of the head, or in many cases
by the neck. In those beetles that have no neck, as the
Lamellicorn and Capricorn, the hind-head is merely a declivity
from the vertex, usually concealed by the shield of
the thorax, very lubricous, to facilitate its motion in the
cavity of that part, and at its posterior margin distinguished
by one or two notches, which I shall notice
hereafter, for the attachment of the levator muscles: but
in those beetles or other insects that have a neck, or a
versatile head, the occiput forms an angle with the vertex,
often rounded, and sometimes acute. This structure may
be seen in Latreille's <i>Trachelides</i>, and several other beetles.
In the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, and others with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
versatile head, the part now under consideration curves
inwards from the vertical line, so as with the temples and
under parts of the head to form a concavity adapted to
its movement upon the trunk.</p>

<p>vi. <i>GenÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1427_1427" id="FNanchor_1427_1427"></a><a href="#Footnote_1427_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a>.&mdash;The <i>cheeks</i> of insects (<i>GenÃ¦</i>) usually surround
the anterior part of the eyes, and lie between them
and the mandibles or their representatives. Where they
approach the latter, as in the Predaceous beetles (<i>Cicindela</i>,
<i>Carabus</i> L. &amp;c.), they are very short, and of course
longer where the eyes are further removed from the
mouth; as in the Rhyncophorous beetles (<i>Curculio</i> L.),
where they form the sides of the rostrum, and often contain
a channel which receives the first joint of the antennÃ¦,
when they are unemployed. In the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> and
many other Lamellicorn beetles, their separation on each
side from the nose is marked by a ridge<a name="FNanchor_1428_1428" id="FNanchor_1428_1428"></a><a href="#Footnote_1428_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a>; and in the
wasps (<i>Vespa</i>) by an impressed line or channel. In an
African tribe at present arranged with <i>Cetonia</i> F., to
which <i>C. bicornis</i> Latr.<a name="FNanchor_1429_1429" id="FNanchor_1429_1429"></a><a href="#Footnote_1429_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a> and another, which he has named,
I believe, <i>C. vitticollis</i>, belong, the cheeks are porrected
on each side of the mouth into a horizontal horn. These
horns have at first the aspect of a pair of open mandibles.
In the magnificent <i>Goliathi</i> Lam., the horns of the male
are rather a process of the <i>cheek</i> than of the <i>nose</i>. In
<i>Alurnus</i>, <i>Hispa</i>, and other beetles, these parts, by their
elevation and conjunction with the lower side of the
head, form a kind of fence which surrounds and protects
the oral organs; in many <i>CimicidÃ¦</i>, by a similar elevation
of the cheeks, the bed of the <i>promuscis</i> is formed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
In the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i> they run parallel nearly
with the <i>rhinarium</i> or nostril-piece. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
they are almost always ample, but they are confined to
the lower side of the eye. In <i>Sirex grandis</i>, and others of
that genus, the cheek at the base of the mandible is dilated
so as to form a rounded tooth below it. In the
Capricorn-beetles it is considerable, and sometimes terminates,
at the base of the mandible, in two or three
notches. In <i>Scaurus</i> and <i>Eurychora</i>, darkling-beetles,
the cheek below projects into a lobe that covers the base
of the <i>maxilla</i>. But the animal distinguished by the
most remarkable cheeks is a species of <i>Phryganea</i> L.
(<i>Phryganea personata</i> Spence); for from this part projects
a spoon-shaped process, which curves upwards, and
uniting with that of the other cheek, forms an ample mask
before the face, the anterior and upper margin of which,
in the insect's natural state, are closely united; and the
posterior part being applied to the anterior part of the
eye, causes the face to appear much swoln. It looks as
if it was a single piece; but upon pressing the thorax it
opens, both above and in front, into two parts, each convex
without and hollow within, and each having attached
to its inside a yellow tuft of hair resembling a feather.
The use of this machinery at present remains a mystery<a name="FNanchor_1430_1430" id="FNanchor_1430_1430"></a><a href="#Footnote_1430_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a>.</p>

<p>vii. <i>Tempora</i><a name="FNanchor_1431_1431" id="FNanchor_1431_1431"></a><a href="#Footnote_1431_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a>.&mdash;The temples (<i>Tempora</i>) are merely
a continuation of the cheeks to the posterior limit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
head, forming its sides and posterior angles, and including
the hinder part of the eyes, the vertex, and the occiput.
They seldom exhibit any tangible character, except
in certain ants (<i>Atta</i> Latr.), in which their angle
terminates in one or two strong spines, giving the animal
a most ferocious aspect; and in that remarkable genus
<i>Corydalis</i> they are armed below with a tooth or point,
which was not overlooked by De Geer<a name="FNanchor_1432_1432" id="FNanchor_1432_1432"></a><a href="#Footnote_1432_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a>.</p>

of more importance and interest, and which indeed include
a world of wonders: I mean the eyes (<i>Oculi</i>) of
insects. These differ widely from those of vertebrate
animals, being incapable of motion. They may be regarded
as of <i>three</i> descriptions&mdash;<i>simple</i>, <i>conglomerate</i>,
and <i>compound</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Simple Eyes</i><a name="FNanchor_1434_1434" id="FNanchor_1434_1434"></a><a href="#Footnote_1434_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a>. We will consider them as to their
<i>number</i>, <i>structure</i>, <i>shape</i>, <i>colour</i>, <i>magnitude</i>, <i>situation</i>, and
<i>arrangement</i>.</p>

<p>As to their <i>number</i>, they vary from two to sixteen.
In the flea, the louse, the harvest-man (<i>Phalangium</i>),
there are only <i>a pair</i>; in the bird-louse of the goose
(<i>Nirmus Anseris</i>), and probably in others of the same
genus, there are <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_1435_1435" id="FNanchor_1435_1435"></a><a href="#Footnote_1435_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a>; in some spiders (<i>Scytodes</i>, <i>Dysdera</i>,
and <i>Segestria</i> Latr.<a name="FNanchor_1436_1436" id="FNanchor_1436_1436"></a><a href="#Footnote_1436_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a>), and some scorpions<a name="FNanchor_1437_1437" id="FNanchor_1437_1437"></a><a href="#Footnote_1437_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a>, there
are <i>six</i>. In the majority of spiders and <i>Scolopendra morsitans</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
<i>Scorpio maurus</i>, &amp;c. there are <i>eight</i>; and in <i>Podura</i>
and <i>Sminthurus</i> Latr. there are sixteen<a name="FNanchor_1438_1438" id="FNanchor_1438_1438"></a><a href="#Footnote_1438_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a>.</p>

<p>As to their <i>structure</i>, nothing seems to have been ascertained;
probably their organization does not materially
differ from that of one of the lenses of a compound eye;
which I shall soon explain to you.</p>

<p>Their <i>colour</i> in the many is black and shining, but in
the bird-louse of the goose they are quite white and
transparent. In spiders they are often of a sapphirine
colour, and clear as crystal. In <i>Scolopendra morsitans</i>
and many spiders, scorpions, and <i>phalangia</i><a name="FNanchor_1439_1439" id="FNanchor_1439_1439"></a><a href="#Footnote_1439_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a>, they appear
to consist of iris and pupil, which gives them a
fierce glare, the centre of the eye being dark and the
circumference paler. In the celebrated <i>Tarantula</i> (<i>Lycosa
Tarantula</i>), the pupil is transparent, and red as a
ruby; and the iris more opaque, paler, and nearly the
colour of amber.</p>

<p>Where there are more than two, they vary in <i>magnitude</i>.
In the enormous bird-spider (<i>Mygale avicularia</i>)
the four external eyes are larger than the four internal<a name="FNanchor_1440_1440" id="FNanchor_1440_1440"></a><a href="#Footnote_1440_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a>;
but in the Tarantula and <i>Sphasus</i>, the <i>two</i> or <i>four</i> internal
are the largest. In <i>Clubiona</i> and <i>Drassus</i> they are all
nearly of the same size<a name="FNanchor_1441_1441" id="FNanchor_1441_1441"></a><a href="#Footnote_1441_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a>; and in the <i>Micrommata</i> family
they are very small<a name="FNanchor_1442_1442" id="FNanchor_1442_1442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1442_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a>.</p>

<p>They vary also in <i>shape</i>. In <i>Scolopendra morsitans</i> the
three anterior ones are round, and the posterior one
transverse, and somewhat triangular. In <i>Mygale calpeiana</i>,
a spider, the two smallest are round and the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
oval<a name="FNanchor_1443_1443" id="FNanchor_1443_1443"></a><a href="#Footnote_1443_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a>. In the trapdoor or mason spider (<i>Mygale cÃ¦mentaria</i>),
the four small internal ones are round, and
the large external ones oval<a name="FNanchor_1444_1444" id="FNanchor_1444_1444"></a><a href="#Footnote_1444_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a>; and those that are circumscribed
posteriorly with an impressed semicircle, are
shaped like the moon when gibbous<a name="FNanchor_1445_1445" id="FNanchor_1445_1445"></a><a href="#Footnote_1445_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>situation</i> and <i>arrangement</i> of simple eyes are also
various. In many they are imbedded, as usual, in the
head; but in the little scarlet mite, formerly noticed<a name="FNanchor_1446_1446" id="FNanchor_1446_1446"></a><a href="#Footnote_1446_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a>,
(<i>Trombidium holosericeum</i>), they stand upon a small foot-stalk<a name="FNanchor_1447_1447" id="FNanchor_1447_1447"></a><a href="#Footnote_1447_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a>:
the hairiness of this animal might otherwise have
impeded its sight. In spiders they are planted on the
back of the part that represents the head, sometimes four
on a central elevation or tubercle, and the remaining
four below it&mdash;as in <i>Lycosa</i>; sometimes the whole eight
are on a tubercle, as in <i>Mygale</i>; and sometimes, as in
the common garden-spider (<i>Epeira Diadema</i>), upon
three tubercles, four on the central one and two on each
of the lateral ones. Other variations in this respect might
be named in this tribe. In the scorpions a pair are placed
one on each side, on a dorsal tubercle, and the other four
or six on two lateral ones of the anterior part of the
head<a name="FNanchor_1448_1448" id="FNanchor_1448_1448"></a><a href="#Footnote_1448_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a>. In the <i>PhalangidÃ¦</i> the <i>frontal</i> eyes of the scorpion
cease, and only a pair of <i>dorsal</i> ones are inserted
vertically in the sides of a horn or tubercle, either bifid
or simple, often itself standing upon an elevation which
emerges from the back of the animal<a name="FNanchor_1449_1449" id="FNanchor_1449_1449"></a><a href="#Footnote_1449_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a>. If their eyes
were not in a vertical and elevated position, the sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
these insects would be very limited; but by means of the
structure just stated, they get a considerable range of surrounding
objects, as well as of those above them. With
regard to the <i>arrangement</i> of the eyes we are considering,
it varies much. Sometimes they are placed nearly
in the segment of a circle, as in those spiders that have
<i>six</i> eyes only, before noticed<a name="FNanchor_1450_1450" id="FNanchor_1450_1450"></a><a href="#Footnote_1450_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a>; sometimes in two straight
lines<a name="FNanchor_1451_1451" id="FNanchor_1451_1451"></a><a href="#Footnote_1451_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a>; at others in two segments of a circle<a name="FNanchor_1452_1452" id="FNanchor_1452_1452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1452_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a>; at others,
in <i>three</i> lines<a name="FNanchor_1453_1453" id="FNanchor_1453_1453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1453_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a>, and at others in <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_1454_1454" id="FNanchor_1454_1454"></a><a href="#Footnote_1454_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a>. Again, in some
instances they form a cross, or two triangles<a name="FNanchor_1455_1455" id="FNanchor_1455_1455"></a><a href="#Footnote_1455_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a>; in others,
two squares<a name="FNanchor_1456_1456" id="FNanchor_1456_1456"></a><a href="#Footnote_1456_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a>; in others, a smaller square included in a
large one<a name="FNanchor_1457_1457" id="FNanchor_1457_1457"></a><a href="#Footnote_1457_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a>; in others, a posterior square and two anterior
triangles<a name="FNanchor_1458_1458" id="FNanchor_1458_1458"></a><a href="#Footnote_1458_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a>; sometimes a square and two lines. Though
generally separate from each other, in several cases two
of the eyes touch<a name="FNanchor_1459_1459" id="FNanchor_1459_1459"></a><a href="#Footnote_1459_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a>; and in one instance three coalesce
into a triangle<a name="FNanchor_1460_1460" id="FNanchor_1460_1460"></a><a href="#Footnote_1460_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a>. But it would be endless to mention all
the variations, as to arrangement, in the eyes of spiders.</p>

<p>2. <i>Conglomerate Eyes</i><a name="FNanchor_1461_1461" id="FNanchor_1461_1461"></a><a href="#Footnote_1461_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> differ in nothing from simple
eyes, except that instead of being dispersed they are collected
into a body, so as at first sight to exhibit the appearance
of a compound eye:&mdash;they are, however, not
hexagonal, and are generally convex. They occur in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
<i>Lepisma</i>, the <i>IulidÃ¦</i>, and several of the <i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i>.
In <i>Scolopendra forficata</i> the eye consists of about twenty
contiguous, circular, pellucid lenses, arranged in five
lines, with another larger behind them, as a sentinel or
scout, placed at some little distance from the main body.
In the common millepede (<i>Iulus terrestris</i>) there are
twenty-eight of these eyes, placed in seven rows, and
forming a triangle, thus <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_506.png" alt="triangular eye shape" /></span>&mdash;the posterior row containing
seven lenses, the next six, and so on, gradually
losing one, till the last terminates in unity. Each of
these lenses is umbilicated, or marked with a central depression.
In <i>Craspedosoma</i> Leach, you will find a similar
formation. In <i>Glomeris zonata</i>, a kind of wood-louse
that rolls itself into a ball, the lenses are arranged in a
line curved at the lower end, with a single one by itself
at the posterior end on the outside; they are oblong and
set transversely, and their white hue and transparency
give them the appearance of so many minute gems, especially
as contrasted with the black colour of the animal<a name="FNanchor_1462_1462" id="FNanchor_1462_1462"></a><a href="#Footnote_1462_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a>.
Between these eyes and the antennÃ¦ is another transverse
linear white body, but opaque, seemingly set in a
socket, and surrounded by a white elevated line, like the
bezel of a ring. Whether it is an eye, or what organ, I
cannot conjecture<a name="FNanchor_1463_1463" id="FNanchor_1463_1463"></a><a href="#Footnote_1463_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a>. Its aspect is that of a spiracle.</p>

<p>3. <i>Compound Eyes</i><a name="FNanchor_1464_1464" id="FNanchor_1464_1464"></a><a href="#Footnote_1464_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a>.&mdash;These are the most common kind
of eye in hexapod insects, when arrived at their perfect
state; in their larva state, as we have seen, their eyes
being usually simple<a name="FNanchor_1465_1465" id="FNanchor_1465_1465"></a><a href="#Footnote_1465_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a>; except, indeed, those whose metamorphosis
is <i>semicomplete</i>, which have compound eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
in every state.&mdash;In considering compound eyes, I shall
advert to their <i>structure</i>, <i>number</i>, <i>situation</i>, <i>figure</i>, <i>clothing</i>,
<i>colour</i>, and <i>size</i>.</p>

<p>As to their <i>structure</i>,&mdash;when seen under the microscope
they appear to consist usually of an infinite number of convex
<i>hexagonal</i> pieces. If you examine with a good glass
the eye of any fly, you will find it traversed by numberless
parallel lines, with others equally numerous cutting them
at right angles, so as apparently to form myriads of little
squares, with each a lens of the above figure set in it. The
same structure, though often not so easily seen, obtains in
the eyes of <i>Coleoptera</i> and other insects. When the eye
is separated and made clean, these hexagons are as clear
as crystal. Reaumur fitted one eye to a lens, and could
see through it well, but objects were greatly multiplied<a name="FNanchor_1466_1466" id="FNanchor_1466_1466"></a><a href="#Footnote_1466_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a>.
In Coleopterous insects they are of a hard and horny
substance; but in <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c. more soft and membranous.
The number of lenses in an eye varies in different
insects. Hooke computed those in the eye of a horse-fly
to amount to nearly 7,000<a name="FNanchor_1467_1467" id="FNanchor_1467_1467"></a><a href="#Footnote_1467_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a>; Leeuwenhoeck found
more than 12,000 in that of a dragon-fly<a name="FNanchor_1468_1468" id="FNanchor_1468_1468"></a><a href="#Footnote_1468_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a>; and 17,325
have been counted in that of a butterfly<a name="FNanchor_1469_1469" id="FNanchor_1469_1469"></a><a href="#Footnote_1469_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a>. But of all insects
they seem to be most numerous in the beetles of
Mr. W. S. MacLeay's genus <i>Dynastes</i>. In the eyes of
these the lenses are so small as not to be easily discoverable
even under a pocket microscope, except the eye has
turned white<a name="FNanchor_1470_1470" id="FNanchor_1470_1470"></a><a href="#Footnote_1470_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a>: it is not, therefore, wonderful, that Fabricius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
should call these eyes <i>simple</i><a name="FNanchor_1471_1471" id="FNanchor_1471_1471"></a><a href="#Footnote_1471_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a>. In some insects, however,
as in the <i>Strepsiptera</i> Kirby, the lenses are not numerous:
in <i>Xenos</i> they do not exceed fifty, and are distinctly
visible to the naked eye<a name="FNanchor_1472_1472" id="FNanchor_1472_1472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1472_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a>. These lenses vary in
magnitude, not only in different, but sometimes in the
same eyes. This is the case in those of male horse-flies
and flies, those of the upper part of the eye being much
larger than those of the lower<a name="FNanchor_1473_1473" id="FNanchor_1473_1473"></a><a href="#Footnote_1473_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a>. The partitions that
separate the lenses, or rather bezels, in which they are set,
are very visible in the eyes just mentioned, and those of
<i>Xenos</i>; but in many insects they are only discernible at
the intersecting lines of separation between the lenses.
In hairy eyes, such as those of the hive-bee, the hairs
emerge from these <i>septa</i>. Every single lens of a compound
eye may be considered as a <i>cornea</i>, or a <i>crystalline
humour</i>, it being convex without and concave within,
but thicker in the middle than at the margin: it is the
only transparent part to be found in these most remarkable
eyes. Immediately under the <i>cornea</i> is an opaque
varnish, varying according to the species, which produces
sometimes in one and the same eye spots or bands
of different colours. These spots and bands form a distinguishing
ornament of many of the <i>Tabani</i> and other
flies. And to this varnish the lace-winged flies (<i>Hemerobius</i>,
&amp;c.) are indebted for the beautiful metallic hues
that often adorn them. When insects are dead, this
varnish frequently loses its colour, and the eye turns
white: hence many species are described as having <i>white</i>
eyes which when alive had <i>black</i> ones. The consistence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
of this covering is the same with that of the varnish of
the <i>choroid</i> in the eyes of vertebrate animals; but it entirely
covers the underside of the lens, without leaving
any passage for the light. Below this varnish there are
numbers of short white hexagonal prisms<a name="FNanchor_1474_1474" id="FNanchor_1474_1474"></a><a href="#Footnote_1474_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a>, every one of
which enters the concavity of one of the lenses of the
cornea, and is only separated from it by the varnish just
described: this may be considered as the <i>retina</i> of the
lens to which it is attached; but at present it has not been
clearly explained how the light can act upon a <i>retina</i> of
this description through an opaque varnish. Below this
multitude of threads (for such the bodies appear), perpendicular
to the <i>cornea</i>, is a <i>membrane</i> which serves
them all for a base, and which consequently is nearly parallel
with that part. It is very thin, of a black colour,
not produced by a varnish; and in it may be seen very
fine white <i>tracheÃ¦</i>, which send forth branches still finer,
that penetrate between the prisms of the <i>cornea</i>: this
membrane may be called the <i>choroid</i>. Behind this is a
thin expansion of the optic nerve, which is a true nervous
membrane, precisely similar to the <i>retina</i> of red-blooded
animals. It appears that the white pyramidal
threads which form the <i>retina</i> of each lens are sent forth
by this general <i>retina</i>, and pierce the choroid by a number
of almost imperceptible holes<a name="FNanchor_1475_1475" id="FNanchor_1475_1475"></a><a href="#Footnote_1475_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a>. From this description
it appears that the eyes of insects have nothing corresponding
with the <i>uvea</i> or <i>humours</i> of those of vertebrate
animals, but are of a type peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>Having explained to you the wonderful and complex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
structure with which it has pleased the <span class="smcap">Creator</span> to distinguish
the organs of vision of these minute beings,
proving, what I have so often asserted, that when animals
seem approaching to nonentity, where one would
expect them to be most <i>simple</i>, we find them in many
cases most <i>complex</i>, I shall now call your attention to the
next thing I am to consider&mdash;the <i>number</i> of the eyes in
question. Most insects have only <i>two</i>; but there are several
exceptions to this rule. Those that have occasion
to see both above and below the head, the eyes of all
being immovable, must have them so placed as to enable
them to do this. This end is accomplished in many
beetles, for instance <i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> L., <i>HelÃ¦us</i> Latr., &amp;c., by
having these organs fixed in the <i>side</i> of the head, so that
part looks upward and part downward; but in others
<i>four</i> are given for this purpose. If you examine the
common whirlwig (<i>Gyrinus Natator</i>) that I have so often
mentioned<a name="FNanchor_1476_1476" id="FNanchor_1476_1476"></a><a href="#Footnote_1476_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a>, which has occasion, at the same time, to
observe objects in the air and in the water, you will find
it is gifted with this number of eyes. <i>Lamia Tornator</i>
(<i>Cerambyx tetrophthalmus</i> Forst.) and some others, of
which I make a genus, under the appellation of <i>Tetrops</i>,
are also so distinguished. In these insects, one
eye is above and the other below the base of the antennÃ¦;
in fact, in these the <i>canthus</i>, instead of dividing the
eye partially, as in the other Capricorn-beetles, runs quite
through it at considerable width<a name="FNanchor_1477_1477" id="FNanchor_1477_1477"></a><a href="#Footnote_1477_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a>. In <i>Ryssonotus</i> MacLeay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
(<i>Lucanus nebulosus</i> K.) the eye appears also to be
divided in two by the <i>canthus</i>. In the <i>Neuroptera</i> Order
there is more than one instance of the same kind. In
<i>Ascalaphus</i> there are two considerable eyes on each side
of the head, which, though clearly distinct, meet like
those of many male flies and the drone. The male, likewise,
of more than one species of <i>Ephemera</i>, besides the
common lateral eyes and the <i>stemmata</i> on the back of
the head, have a pair of compound eyes on the top of a
short columnar process<a name="FNanchor_1478_1478" id="FNanchor_1478_1478"></a><a href="#Footnote_1478_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a>. In the <i>Hemiptera</i> Order, also,
an instance occurs of four eyes in the genus <i>Aleyrodes</i><a name="FNanchor_1479_1479" id="FNanchor_1479_1479"></a><a href="#Footnote_1479_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a>.
Amongst the vertebrate animals, there is an example of
eyes with two pupils in <i>Anableps</i>, a genus of fishes<a name="FNanchor_1480_1480" id="FNanchor_1480_1480"></a><a href="#Footnote_1480_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a>, but
no vertebrate animal has <i>four</i> of these organs. That
many insects should have more than <i>two</i> eyes, will not
seem to you so extraordinary as that any should be found
that, like the Cyclops of old, have only <i>one</i>. There is,
however, an insect, before celebrated for its agility<a name="FNanchor_1481_1481" id="FNanchor_1481_1481"></a><a href="#Footnote_1481_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a>
(<i>Machilis polypoda</i> Latr.), which has a single eye in its
forehead; or we may say, its eyes are confluent, without
any line of distinction between them except a small notch
behind. Now that I am treating of the <i>number</i> of eyes,
I must not forget to observe to you, that in some insects
no eyes at all have been discovered. In <i>Polydesmus complanatus</i>,
on each side of the head there is an eye-shaped
portion separated by a suture, in which under a powerful
lens I cannot satisfy myself that I can discern any
thing like the facets that usually distinguish compound
eyes. In <i>Geophilus electricus</i>, another myriapod, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
certainly do not exist<a name="FNanchor_1482_1482" id="FNanchor_1482_1482"></a><a href="#Footnote_1482_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a>. Whence we may conclude, as
was before observed<a name="FNanchor_1483_1483" id="FNanchor_1483_1483"></a><a href="#Footnote_1483_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a>, that the faculty of emitting light
is rather given it as a means of defence than to guide it
in its path.</p>

<p>The <i>situation</i> of compound eyes differs in different
tribes. In some, as in the <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, they are planted
laterally in the <i>anterior</i> part of the head; in others, the
<i>Carabi</i> &amp;c., in the <i>middle</i>; in others again, <i>Locusta</i>
Leach &amp;c., in the <i>posterior</i> part. In some, their station
is more in the upper surface, either before or behind; so
that a very narrow space separates them, or perhaps none
at all. Instances of this position of the eyes occur in a
minute weevil (<i>Ramphus</i> Clairv.<a name="FNanchor_1484_1484" id="FNanchor_1484_1484"></a><a href="#Footnote_1484_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a>), and many <i>Diptera</i>,
&amp;c. Of those that form an union on the top of the head,
some are placed obliquely, so as to leave a diverging
space below them, as in many <i>Libellulina</i><a name="FNanchor_1485_1485" id="FNanchor_1485_1485"></a><a href="#Footnote_1485_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a>, the drone<a name="FNanchor_1486_1486" id="FNanchor_1486_1486"></a><a href="#Footnote_1486_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a>,
&amp;c. Others, as <i>Atractocerus</i>, in which the eyes occupy
nearly the whole head, and unite anteriorly, have this
diverging space <i>above</i> their conflux. In <i>Rhina barbirostris</i>
Latr., another kind of weevil, they are confluent
<i>below</i> the head, at the base of the rostrum, and a very
narrow interval separates them above. In a large number
of the <i>Heteromerous</i> beetles, they are set <i>transversely</i>,
in the <i>Capricorn</i> ones <i>longitudinally</i>. Their surface,
when they are lateral, has usually two aspects, one <i>prone</i>
to see below, the other <i>supine</i> to see above. In general
the eyes are situated behind the antennÃ¦, so that their
position, whether it shall be anterior or posterior, depends
upon that of those organs. Often, indeed, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
the last-named beetles, part of the eye is behind and part
before the antennÃ¦; but except where there are <i>four</i>
eyes, as in <i>Tetrops</i>, they are never placed before or below
them.</p>

<p>Though the eyes of insects are generally <i>sessile</i>, yet to
give them a wider range they are sometimes, but it rarely
occurs, placed, like those of many <i>Crustacea</i>, on a <i>footstalk</i>,
but not a <i>moveable</i> one. An instance of this in certain
male <i>EphemerÃ¦</i> has already been mentioned. In the
<i>Hemiptera</i> De Geer has figured two species of bugs
(<i>CimicidÃ¦</i>) that are so circumstanced<a name="FNanchor_1487_1487" id="FNanchor_1487_1487"></a><a href="#Footnote_1487_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a>; as are also all
the known <i>Strepsiptera</i> K., though in these the footstalk
is very short<a name="FNanchor_1488_1488" id="FNanchor_1488_1488"></a><a href="#Footnote_1488_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a>: but the most remarkable example of columnar
eyes is afforded by that curious <i>Dipterous</i> genus
<i>Diopsis</i>, in which both eyes and antennÃ¦ stand upon a
pair of branches, vastly longer than the head, which diverge
at a very obtuse angle from its posterior part<a name="FNanchor_1489_1489" id="FNanchor_1489_1489"></a><a href="#Footnote_1489_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a>.</p>

<p>In their <i>figure</i> eyes vary much. Sometimes they are so
prominent as to be nearly <i>spherical</i>: this is the case with
some aquatic bugs, as <i>Ranatra</i>, <i>Hydrometra</i>, and several
male <i>EphemerÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1490_1490" id="FNanchor_1490_1490"></a><a href="#Footnote_1490_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a>. Very often they are <i>hemispherical</i>, as
in the tiger-beetles (<i>Cicindela</i> L.), and the clocks or dors
(<i>Carabus</i> L.); but in a large number of insects they are
flat, and do not rise above the surface of the head.&mdash;With
regard to their <i>outline</i>, they are often perfectly
<i>round</i>, as in many weevils; <i>oval</i>, as in various bees;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
<i>ovate</i>, as in other bees (<i>Andrena</i> F.); <i>triangular</i>, as in the
water-boatman (<i>Notonecta</i>). They are also often <i>oblong</i>,
and occasionally narrow and <i>linear</i>; as in that singular
beetle <i>HelÃ¦us</i>. In many of the <i>MuscidÃ¦</i> they form
nearly a <i>semicircle</i>, or rather, perhaps, the quadrant of a
sphere. The eyes of the Capricorn-beetles (<i>Cerambyx</i> L.)
have a sinus on their inner side, as it were, taken out of
them; so that they more than half surround the antennÃ¦,
before which is the longest portion of them. An
approach to this shape is more or less observed in the
darkling-beetles (<i>Tenebrio</i> L.); but in these the sinus is
not so deep. I may under this head observe, that in
those <i>MantidÃ¦</i> that represent dry leaves, and some others,
these organs usually terminate in a spine<a name="FNanchor_1491_1491" id="FNanchor_1491_1491"></a><a href="#Footnote_1491_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a>.</p>

<p>Though not distinguished by the beauty and animation
that give such interest to the eye of vertebrate animals,
and exhibiting no trace of iris or pupil, yet from
the variety of their <i>colours</i> the compound eyes of insects,
though most commonly black or brown, are often very
striking. Look at those of one of the lace-winged flies
that commit such havoc amongst the <i>Aphides</i><a name="FNanchor_1492_1492" id="FNanchor_1492_1492"></a><a href="#Footnote_1492_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a>, and it
will dazzle you with the splendour of the purest gold,
sometimes softened with a lovely green. The lenses of
those of <i>Xenos</i> blaze like diamonds set in jet<a name="FNanchor_1493_1493" id="FNanchor_1493_1493"></a><a href="#Footnote_1493_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a>. You
have often noticed the fiery eyes of many horse-flies
(<i>Tabanus</i> L.) with vivid bands of purple and green<a name="FNanchor_1494_1494" id="FNanchor_1494_1494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1494_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a>.
Others are spotted<a name="FNanchor_1495_1495" id="FNanchor_1495_1495"></a><a href="#Footnote_1495_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a>; and Schellenberg has figured one
(<i>Thereva hemiptera</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1496_1496" id="FNanchor_1496_1496"></a><a href="#Footnote_1496_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a>, that exhibits the figure of a flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
painted in red on a black ground. These colours and
markings are all most vivid and brilliant in the <i>living</i>
insect, and often impart that fire and animation to the
eyes for which those of the higher animals are remarkable.
Take one of the large dragon-flies that you see
hawking about the hedges in search of prey, examine its
eyes under a lens, and you will be astonished at the brilliance
and crystalline transparency which its large eyes
exhibit, and by the remarkable vision of larger hexagons
which appear in motion under the <i>cornea</i>, being reflected
by the <i>retina</i>&mdash;all which give it the appearance of a
living eye. This moving reflexion of the hexagonal
lenses in living insects was noticed long since in some
bees (<i>Nomada</i> F., <i>C&#339;lioxys</i> Latr.)<a name="FNanchor_1497_1497" id="FNanchor_1497_1497"></a><a href="#Footnote_1497_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a></p>

<p>Compound eyes differ greatly in their <i>size</i>. In some
insects, as <i>Atractocerus</i>, the drone-bee, many male <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>,
&amp;c., they occupy nearly the whole of the head;
while in others, as numerous <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, <i>Locusta</i>
Leach, &amp;c., they are so small as to be scarcely larger
than some simple eyes of spiders: and they exhibit
every intermediate difference of magnitude in different
tribes, genera, and species.</p>

<p>Under this head I must say something of the <i>Canthus</i>
of the eye; by which I mean an elevated process of the
cheek, which in almost all the genera of the Lamellicorn
beetles enters the eye more or less, dividing the upper
portion from the lower. Though usually only a <i>process</i> of
the cheek, yet in the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> the whole of that part
forms the <i>canthus</i><a name="FNanchor_1498_1498" id="FNanchor_1498_1498"></a><a href="#Footnote_1498_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a>. It only <i>enters</i> the eye in the <i>RutelidÃ¦</i>,
<i>CetonidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c.; it extends through <i>half</i> of it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
<i>Copris</i>; it goes <i>beyond</i> the half in <i>Ateuchus</i>; and in <i>Ryssonotus</i>
MacLeay (<i>Lucanus nebulosus</i> K.) it quite divides
the eye into two<a name="FNanchor_1499_1499" id="FNanchor_1499_1499"></a><a href="#Footnote_1499_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a>, as I before observed. In <i>Lucanus</i>,
<i>Passalus</i> &amp;c. it projects before the eye into an angle; in
<i>Lucanus femoralis</i> nearly into a spine; but in <i>Lamprima</i>
and <i>&#338;salus</i> it does not exist. The part, also, that enters
the eye in the Capricorn-beetles may be regarded as a
kind of <i>canthus</i>, though it is merely a dilatation of the
<i>front</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>Stemmata</i><a name="FNanchor_1500_1500" id="FNanchor_1500_1500"></a><a href="#Footnote_1500_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a>.&mdash;Having given so full an account of
the kinds and structure of the ordinary eyes of insects,
you may perhaps expect that I should now dismiss the
subject: you would, however, have great cause to blame
me, did I not make you acquainted with a kind of auxiliary
eyes with which a large portion of them are gifted;
I mean those pellucid spots often to be found on the posterior
part of the front of these animals, or upon the vertex,
frequently arranged in a triangle. These, LinnÃ©, from
his regarding them as a kind of coronet, called <i>Stemmata</i>.
They have been of late denominated <i>Ocelli</i>; but
as this latter term is also in general use for the eyelets on
the wings of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, I have adhered to that of the
illustrious Swede. Neither he nor Fabricius has expressed
any opinion as to the <i>use</i> of these organs; but
Swammerdam and Reaumur were aware that they were
real <i>eyes</i>. The former found that there are nerves that
diverge to them though not easily traced, and that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
have a <i>cornea</i>, and what he takes for the <i>uvea</i><a name="FNanchor_1501_1501" id="FNanchor_1501_1501"></a><a href="#Footnote_1501_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a>; and the
latter has supposed that the compound eyes and these
simple ones have, the one the power of magnifying objects
much, and the other but little, so that the former
are for surveying those that are distant, and the latter
those that are near<a name="FNanchor_1502_1502" id="FNanchor_1502_1502"></a><a href="#Footnote_1502_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a>. The same author relates some experiments
that he tried with the common hive bee, by
which he ascertained that the <i>stemmata</i>, as well as the
compound eyes, were organs of vision. He first smeared
the <i>latter</i> over with paint, and the animals, instead of
making for their hive, rose in the air till he lost sight of
them. He next did the same with the <i>former</i>, and placing
the bees whose <i>stemmata</i> he had painted within a few
paces of their hive, they flew about on all sides among
the neighbouring plants, but never far: he did not observe
that these ever rose in the air like the others<a name="FNanchor_1503_1503" id="FNanchor_1503_1503"></a><a href="#Footnote_1503_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a>.
From this experiment it seems as if the compound eyes
were for <i>horizontal</i> sight, and the <i>stemmata</i> for <i>vertical</i>.</p>

<p>The definition of them by LinnÃ© and Fabricius as
smooth, shining, elevated or hemispheric puncta, conveys
a very inadequate idea of them; for, except in a
very few instances, they are perfectly clear and transparent,
and their appearance is precisely the same as that
of the simple eyes of <i>Arachnida</i> &amp;c., under which head
they might very well have been arranged; but as the last
are <i>primary</i> eyes, and the stemmata <i>secondary</i>, it seemed
to me best that they should stand by themselves. The
structure of both is probably the same, and their internal
organization that of one of the lenses of a compound
eye, and both are set in a socket of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span></p>

<p>Though a large number of insects have them, they are
by no means universal, since some Orders, as the <i>Strepsiptera</i>,
<i>Dermaptera</i>, and <i>Aptera</i>, are altogether without
them. The <i>Coleoptera</i>, also, have been supposed to afford
no instance of species furnished with them; but in the
last number of Germar and Zincken Sommer's <i>Magasin</i>,
it is affirmed that they are discoverable in Gravenhorst's
genus <i>Omalium</i>, but not in the kindred genera <i>Micropeplus</i>
and <i>Anthophagus</i><a name="FNanchor_1504_1504" id="FNanchor_1504_1504"></a><a href="#Footnote_1504_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a>. Upon examining the former
genus, I find, that although <i>Omalium planum</i> and affinities,
<i>O. striatulum</i>, and some others, appear not to have
them, yet with the aid of a good magnifier they may be
discovered in most species of that genus; as likewise in
<i>Ev&#339;sthetus</i> Grav. I find them also very conspicuous in
<i>A. Caraboides</i> and other <i>Anthophagi</i>, but some species
appear to want them. In these insects they are two in
number, situated in the vertex a little behind the eyes but
within them, and either at each end of a transverse furrow,
or at the posterior termination of two longitudinal ones.
Nor are they found in all the genera of the other Orders.
In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, the <i>BlattidÃ¦</i>, unless a white smooth
spot on the inner and upper side of the eyes may be regarded
as representing them, have them not; but in all
the other genera of that Order they are to be found<a name="FNanchor_1505_1505" id="FNanchor_1505_1505"></a><a href="#Footnote_1505_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a>.
In the <i>Hemiptera</i> all the <i>CicadiadÃ¦</i> are gifted with them;
as are likewise <i>Tetyra</i>, <i>Pentatoma</i>, with many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
<i>CimicidÃ¦</i>, and the <i>ReduviadÃ¦</i> very remarkably; but many
others in both sections of this order, as <i>Thrips</i>, <i>Coccus</i>,
<i>Aphis</i>, <i>Capsus</i>, <i>Miris</i>, <i>Naucoris</i>, <i>Nepa</i>, and <i>Notonecta</i>, &amp;c.
are deprived of them<a name="FNanchor_1506_1506" id="FNanchor_1506_1506"></a><a href="#Footnote_1506_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a>. Of the <i>Neuroptera</i> the <i>Libellulina</i>
add <i>stemmata</i> to their large eyes, in the anterior
angle of which they are stationed<a name="FNanchor_1507_1507" id="FNanchor_1507_1507"></a><a href="#Footnote_1507_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a>; but many other genera
of that Order are without them; as <i>Myrmeleon</i>, <i>Ascalaphus</i>,
<i>Hemerobius</i>, &amp;c. The <i>Trichoptera</i> and <i>Lepidoptera</i>
universally have them; though in the latter,
except in <i>Castnia</i> and the <i>SphingidÃ¦</i>, they are not easily
seen. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> they are usually very
conspicuous, but in <i>Larra</i> and <i>Lyrops</i>, two genera of this
order, the posterior pair are scarcely discernible; and in
the neuter ants they are quite obsolete. In the <i>Diptera</i>,
though many genera are furnished with them, yet many
also want them; amongst the rest Latreille's <i>TipulariÃ¦</i>,
and all the horse-flies (<i>Tabanus</i> L.). The <i>PupiparÃ¦</i>
(<i>Hippobosca</i> L.) usually have none; but in <i>Ornithomyia
avicularia</i>, one of that tribe, though extremely minute
they are visible, arranged in a triangle, in the polished
space of their vertex.</p>

<p>As to the <i>Number</i> of the <i>stemmata</i>, <i>three</i> appears to
be most universal. Reaumur mentions an instance in
which he counted <i>four</i> in a fly with two threads at its
tail; but great doubt rests upon this statement<a name="FNanchor_1508_1508" id="FNanchor_1508_1508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1508_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a>. Some
Orthopterous genera, as <i>Gryllotalpa</i>, and many Hemipterous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
as <i>Tetyra</i>, <i>Pentatoma</i>, <i>Reduvius</i><a name="FNanchor_1509_1509" id="FNanchor_1509_1509"></a><a href="#Footnote_1509_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a>, <i>Cercopis</i>,
<i>Fulgora</i><a name="FNanchor_1510_1510" id="FNanchor_1510_1510"></a><a href="#Footnote_1510_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a>, &amp;c., have no more than <i>two</i>; and in <i>Larra</i>
and its affinities, as just observed, the posterior ones are
obsolete, so as to leave only <i>one</i> discernible.</p>

<p>Where there are <i>three</i> of these organs, they are usually
arranged in an obverse <i>triangle</i> in the space behind
the antennÃ¦, at a greater or less distance from them.
In those male flies (<i>MuscidÃ¦</i>) whose eyes are confluent,
the <i>stemmata</i> are in a little area <i>behind</i> their conflux;
but, as before observed, in the drone-bee and the <i>Libellulina</i>
they are <i>before</i> it. This triangle is in some cases
nearly <i>equilateral</i>, as in <i>Perla</i> related to the may-flies,
and many <i>Hymenoptera</i>; in others it is <i>acutangular</i>, as
in <i>Locusta</i> &amp;c., in which the <i>stemma</i> forming the vertex
of the triangle is before the antenna<a name="FNanchor_1511_1511" id="FNanchor_1511_1511"></a><a href="#Footnote_1511_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a>: in others, again,
it is <i>obtusangular</i>, as you will see in <i>Pepsis</i> and various
<i>Hymenoptera</i>. In the humble-bees (<i>Bombus</i>), a line
drawn through them would form a slight curve. Their
<i>situation</i> also varies. In insects that have only <i>two</i>,
they are sometimes placed a little <i>behind</i> the eyes, or in
the back part of the space between them: this is the case
with most of the bugs (<i>Cimex</i> L.) that have them.&mdash;They
are often <i>distant</i>, as in <i>Tetyra</i> F., <i>Edessa</i> F.; and
sometimes <i>approximated</i>, as in <i>Reduvius</i> F.<a name="FNanchor_1512_1512" id="FNanchor_1512_1512"></a><a href="#Footnote_1512_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> In many
of the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, as <i>Cercopis</i>, <i>Ledra</i>, &amp;c.
they are planted in the <i>upper</i> part of the head<a name="FNanchor_1513_1513" id="FNanchor_1513_1513"></a><a href="#Footnote_1513_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a>, but in
<i>Iassus</i> their situation is on the <i>under</i> part; and in a North
American subgenus, as yet without a name, they are exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
<i>between</i> the two, being placed in the frontal angle.
In <i>Fulgora</i> their station is between the eyes and antennÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_1514_1514" id="FNanchor_1514_1514"></a><a href="#Footnote_1514_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a>.
They are most commonly <i>sessile</i>, and as it were <i>set</i> in
the head; but in some, as <i>Fulgora candelaria</i>, they stand
on a <i>footstalk</i>. The <i>stemmata</i> are set in the side of a
frontal tubercle in that four-winged fly of threatening
aspect, <i>Corydalis</i>, which in its <i>perfect state</i> has mandibles,
but longer and more tremendous, like those that
distinguish the <i>larva</i> only of the kindred genus <i>Hemerobius</i><a name="FNanchor_1515_1515" id="FNanchor_1515_1515"></a><a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a>.
These organs differ little in <i>shape</i>, being usually
perfectly <i>round</i> and somewhat <i>convex</i>; but occasionally
they vary in this respect. In <i>Fulgora serrata</i> they are
<i>oblong</i>, with a longitudinal depression; in <i>F. Diadema</i>
they are also umbilicated, but the <i>umbilicus</i> is circular;
in <i>Corydalis</i> they are <i>oval</i>; in other insects they are
<i>ovate</i>; in some <i>semicircular</i>, and in a few <i>triangular</i>.
They vary much in <i>size</i>: in some of these animals being
so minute as to be scarcely visible, while in others, as
<i>Corydalis</i>, <i>Dorylus</i>, <i>Vespa pallida</i> F., <i>Reduvius</i>, &amp;c.<a href="#Footnote_1515_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a>,
they are as large as some compound eyes. They differ
also in <i>colour</i>, though often <i>black</i>: in <i>Fulgora laternaria</i>
they are of a beautiful <i>yellow</i>; in F. <i>candelaria</i> they are
<i>white</i>; in many <i>Hymenoptera</i> they are <i>crystalline</i>, in
others <i>red</i>: the fierce look of <i>Reduvius personatus</i> is rendered
more hateful by its <i>stemmata</i> having a pale iris
round a dark pupil<a name="FNanchor_1516_1516" id="FNanchor_1516_1516"></a><a href="#Footnote_1516_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a>.</p>

<p>Let us here stop and adore the goodness of a beneficent
<span class="smcap">Creator</span>, who, though he has deprived these little
beings of the <i>moveable</i> eyes with which he has gifted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
higher animals, has made it up to them by the variety
and complex structure of their organs of vision, where
<i>we</i> have only <i>two</i> points of sight, giving <i>them</i> more than
as many <i>myriads</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>AntennÃ¦.</i>&mdash;But of all the organs of insects, none
appear to be of more importance to them than their <i>AntennÃ¦</i>,
and none certainly are more wonderful and more
various in their structure, and probably uses. Upon
this last particular I shall enlarge hereafter. Their
structure, as far as it differs in the sexes, I fully discussed
in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_1517_1517" id="FNanchor_1517_1517"></a><a href="#Footnote_1517_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a>; and the most remarkable
kinds of them will be included in a set of definitions
which I shall draw up for you before our correspondence
on this part of my subject closes: I shall therefore now
confine myself to the following particulars&mdash;namely, their
<i>number</i>, <i>insertion</i>, <i>substance</i>, <i>situation</i>, <i>proportion</i>, <i>general
form</i> and <i>structure</i>, <i>clothing</i>, <i>expansion</i>, <i>motions</i>, and <i>station
of repose</i>.</p>

<p>As to their <i>Number</i>, in the majority of <i>crustaceous</i> animals
the antennÃ¦ amount to <i>four</i>, but no <i>insect</i> has more
than <i>two</i>. A genus recently established (<i>Otiocerus</i> Kirby<a name="FNanchor_1518_1518" id="FNanchor_1518_1518"></a><a href="#Footnote_1518_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a>)
seems to afford an exception to this rule, since the
species composing it at first sight appear to have <i>four</i>,
and in some instances even <i>six</i> antennÃ¦; but as only <i>two</i>
of them terminate in a bristle, the other, though proceeding
from the same bed of membrane, may perhaps
be regarded as merely appendages. Germar, who has described
a species of this genus<a name="FNanchor_1519_1519" id="FNanchor_1519_1519"></a><a href="#Footnote_1519_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> under the name of <i>Cobax
Wintheri</i>, considers these appendages as analogous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
to <i>palpi</i>: but as they do not proceed from the <i>oral</i> organs,
but from the bed of the <i>antennÃ¦</i> at the base of the
nose<a name="FNanchor_1520_1520" id="FNanchor_1520_1520"></a><a href="#Footnote_1520_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a>, they ought certainly to be regarded rather as accessories
to the latter, than as representing the former.
In the <i>Aptera</i> order the mites (<i>Acacus</i> L.) appear to be
without these organs. In the pupiparous tribe <i>Hippobosca</i>
they seem about to disappear; and in the <i>Arachnida</i>
&amp;c., as has been more than once observed<a name="FNanchor_1521_1521" id="FNanchor_1521_1521"></a><a href="#Footnote_1521_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a>, the
<i>mandibulÃ¦</i> have been thought to represent, not indeed
the antennÃ¦ of <i>insects</i>, but the <i>inner</i> pair of those of the
<i>Crustacea</i>.</p>

<p>In considering the <i>insertion</i> of antennÃ¦, by which I
mean their articulation with the head, we must advert
first to the orifice (<i>Torulus</i>) that receives them<a name="FNanchor_1522_1522" id="FNanchor_1522_1522"></a><a href="#Footnote_1522_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a>. This
is a perforation of the crust of the head; commonly,
though not invariably, circular: in Coleopterous insects
often with concave lubricous sides, forming an acetabulum,
with processes usual in ginglymous articulations,
larger than the bulb or root of the antennÃ¦; and which is
commonly covered, except the central space occupied by
the bulb, with a tense membrane. Though not in general
remarkable, in some cases it merits attention. In the
genus <i>Rhipicera</i> Latr., the elegant antennÃ¦ of whose
males I have described in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_1523_1523" id="FNanchor_1523_1523"></a><a href="#Footnote_1523_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a>, particularly
the Brazilian species, it is a long process on each side of
the nose, and might be mistaken for the first joint: in
another Coleopterous genus, <i>Priocera</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_1524_1524" id="FNanchor_1524_1524"></a><a href="#Footnote_1524_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a>, it has somewhat
of the shape of a trumpet: in <i>Cupes</i> a tubercle rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
just above the base of the antenna: a circular process
forms the torulus in <i>Fulgora</i> and others. It is also often
placed in a cavity of the front, as in several wild-bees,
<i>Melitta</i> K., and in <i>Locusta</i> Leach on the sides of an elevation
of that part<a name="FNanchor_1525_1525" id="FNanchor_1525_1525"></a><a href="#Footnote_1525_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a>. In a large majority of insects the
bulb (<i>Bulbus</i>) or ball which is received by the bed, wears
the appearance, especially in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, of a distinct
joint; but if you carefully examine it, you will
clearly see that it is merely the base of the <i>scape</i> swelled
out into a spherical or other kindred form<a name="FNanchor_1526_1526" id="FNanchor_1526_1526"></a><a href="#Footnote_1526_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a>; and often
marked, as in the <i>CicindelidÃ¦</i>, with impressed points:
as it is the piece by which the antenna moves in its socket,
this form of a <i>rotula</i> was doubtless given for its more
ready motion in all directions. This structure is principally
conspicuous in the <i>Coleoptera</i> and <i>Hymenoptera</i>
Orders: in the others the base is not so distinguished
from the rest of the scape. If you carefully extract the
antennÃ¦ of a beetle, say a <i>Copris</i> or <i>Lamia</i>, and examine
its base or bottom, you will find that it is open for
the transmission of muscles and nerves; that in its upper
margin it has a deep notch or sinus, on each side of
which is a smaller notch; and that all round the margin,
which is very lubricous, a membranous ligament is attached,
by which it was affixed in the torulus. Its articulation,
therefore, seems of a mixed kind, like that of
most other organs and parts of insects, partaking of the
ligamentous, ginglymous, and ball and socket. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
<i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Hemiptera</i>, &amp;c. the articulation seems more
purely ligamentous.</p>

<p>With regard to their <i>substance</i>&mdash;these organs are regulated,
in some degree, by the nature of the integument
of the animal of which they are appendages; in the
softer insects being of a softer substance than they are in
hard ones. The vertex of the joints, where they receive
the succeeding one, appears in many cases to be softer
than the rest of it, and especially towards the apex, often
papillose. The antennÃ¦ are generally opaque; but in
<i>Nebria complanata</i>, a beetle common on the sea-coast in
Wales and Lincolnshire, they are semitransparent.</p>

<p>The <i>situation</i> of antennÃ¦ must next be considered.
In this respect it seems necessary that they should be
so situated as to be under the direction of the eyes: for
if you examine ten thousand insects (except, as was before
observed<a name="FNanchor_1527_1527" id="FNanchor_1527_1527"></a><a href="#Footnote_1527_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a>, where there are <i>four</i> eyes), you will not
find one in which these organs are situated either above
or immediately behind them; their station being always
either somewhere in the space between the eyes or that
below them. In <i>Ptinus</i> F. they are placed near the
vertex; but in <i>Gibbium</i>, which is so nearly related to
that destructive genus<a name="FNanchor_1528_1528" id="FNanchor_1528_1528"></a><a href="#Footnote_1528_1528" class="fnanchor">[1528]</a>, they are beneath them. In
many <i>MelittÃ¦</i> K. they are in the middle of the space
between the eyes; and in many other <i>Hymenoptera</i> and
<i>Coleoptera</i> (<i>Staphylinus</i> &amp;c.), in the anterior part of it.
In many Lamellicorn genera (except in some <i>AcridÃ¦</i>, as <i>A. viridissima</i>) as <i>Melolontha</i>, <i>Cetonia</i>,
<i>Lucanus</i>, &amp;c. they may be regarded as planted in the
lower surface of the cheek before the eyes; but in <i>Copris</i>
&amp;c., in which they are inserted further under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
shield of the head, they are properly in the <i>prone</i> surface
of the <i>front</i>. In the Capricorn-beetles (<i>Cerambyx</i> L.) and
<i>Cnodalon</i> F. they may be termed <i>inocular</i>, or placed in
a sinus of the eye; in the former tribe in its <i>interior</i>, and
in the latter its <i>anterior</i> side. In the Rhynchophorous or
rostrum-bearing beetles (<i>Curculio</i> L.) they vary in their
situation. Thus in <i>Macrocephalus</i> Oliv. they are inserted
at its apex; in <i>Anthribus</i> in its middle, and in <i>Calandra</i>
at its base<a name="FNanchor_1529_1529" id="FNanchor_1529_1529"></a><a href="#Footnote_1529_1529" class="fnanchor">[1529]</a>. In the water-scorpions (<i>Nepa</i>, <i>Belostoma</i>,
&amp;c.) they may be called <i>extraocular</i>, being placed under
the head in its prone part, outside the eyes<a name="FNanchor_1530_1530" id="FNanchor_1530_1530"></a><a href="#Footnote_1530_1530" class="fnanchor">[1530]</a>. In <i>Nirmus
FringillÃ¦</i>, a kind of bird-louse, they appear to be
<i>oral</i>, being situated, according to De Geer, under the
head near the mouth, at a great distance from the
eyes<a name="FNanchor_1531_1531" id="FNanchor_1531_1531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1531_1531" class="fnanchor">[1531]</a>.</p>

<p>In their <i>proportions</i>, both as to length and thickness,
antennÃ¦ vary extremely. Thus sometimes they are very
short&mdash;much shorter than the head; as in the aquatic
beetles <i>Gyrinus</i>, <i>Parnus</i>, and the water-scorpion; and
some land-beetles, as <i>Anthrenus</i>, &amp;c. At other times they
far exceed the length of the insect: the males of many
Capricorn-beetles are so distinguished. In that of <i>Lamia
Ã¦dilis</i> they are more than <i>four</i> times as long as the
body; and every intermediate length between these two
may be found amongst them. They vary also greatly in
<i>thickness</i>: in <i>Paussus</i>, whose antennÃ¦ emit light in the
night<a name="FNanchor_1532_1532" id="FNanchor_1532_1532"></a><a href="#Footnote_1532_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a>, and <i>Cerapterus</i>, they are nearly as thick,&mdash;at
least their knob, which forms the chief part of them,&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
the body of the insect<a name="FNanchor_1533_1533" id="FNanchor_1533_1533"></a><a href="#Footnote_1533_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a>; while in <i>Mantis</i>, <i>Acrida</i> K. and
<i>Psocus</i>, they are as slender as a hair. The antennÃ¦ in
many of the <i>Prioni</i>, especially in <i>P. imbricornis</i>, are thick
from base to tip; while in other Capricorn-beetles they
are quite the reverse.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to enlarge here upon the general
<i>form</i> of these organs: I shall therefore only notice
the two principal divisions of them in this respect.&mdash;AntennÃ¦,
regard being had to one of their uses, may be
divided into two sections, distinguished by forms extremely
different: those, namely, that are employed by
insects as <i>tactors</i> to explore their way, and those that
cannot be so employed. The great majority are of the
former kind; but those that may be denominated <i>setigerous</i>,&mdash;as
the antennÃ¦ of the <i>Libellulina</i>, <i>Ephemerina</i>, of
the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, and of many <i>Diptera</i>, the
last joint of which terminates in a bristle, or is furnished
with a lateral one, and of some gnats that have short
feathered antennÃ¦,&mdash;appear not fitted to be used as tactors
to explore by touch, and form the latter description.
This difference in these organs, as I shall have occasion
to prove more at large hereafter, furnishes a strong presumption
that their <i>primary</i> function is not <i>touch</i>. Were
this the case, it would be common to them all.</p>

<p>As to their <i>structure</i>, antennÃ¦ consist in general of a
number of tubular joints; each of which having separate
motion, the animal is thereby enabled to give them every
flexure necessary for its purposes. The <i>scape</i>, or first
joint, by means of the bulb inosculates in the <i>torulus</i>, or
is suspended to it; and the others, sometimes by a similar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
though less pronounced knob at their base, inosculate
in the preceding one; but in some cases the inosculation
seems not so perfect, the joints being simply suspended
by ligament. In pectinated or lamellated antennÃ¦,
the branch is usually a lateral process of the joint
from which it issues; but in <i>Phengodes</i> (<i>Lampyris plumosa</i>
L.) its involute plumose branches appear to articulate
with the apex of each joint<a name="FNanchor_1534_1534" id="FNanchor_1534_1534"></a><a href="#Footnote_1534_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a>. I have a specimen
of one of the <i>CleridÃ¦</i>, of a genus undescribed, in which
each branch is forked. In some tribes of the Capricorn-beetles
(<i>Stenocorus</i>, &amp;c.) the antennÃ¦ are often armed at
their apex with spines, sometimes on the upper side and
sometimes below. In some aquatic beetles (<i>Gyrinus</i>,
<i>Parnus</i>) they are furnished with an auricle at their base,
which, like the lid of a box, shuts them in when unemployed,
and protects them from the water<a name="FNanchor_1535_1535" id="FNanchor_1535_1535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1535_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a>.</p>

<p>The portions into which antennÃ¦ may in general be
considered as divided, have been sufficiently explained
to you above; but it may not be amiss to add here a few
words on the principal variations in their structure that
I have had an opportunity of observing. The <i>scapus</i><a name="FNanchor_1536_1536" id="FNanchor_1536_1536"></a><a href="#Footnote_1536_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a>
or first joint, which includes the <i>bulbus</i>, is usually the
most conspicuous joint in the antenna (exclusive, I mean,
of the <i>capitulum</i>, in those in which that organ terminates
in a knob), it being thicker and often longer than the succeeding
ones. In the Capricorn and Darkling beetles,
indeed (<i>Cerambyx</i> and <i>Tenebrio</i> L.), the third joint is the
longest, but the scape is still the thickest; and in the
stag-beetles (<i>Lucanus</i> L.), many of the weevil tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
(<i>Curculio</i> L.), and those of the bees (<i>Apis</i> L.), except in
the males, it is as long nearly as the remainder of the
antennÃ¦, which forms an angle with it. In shape it is
generally somewhat curved and subclavate, or increasing
in size from the base to the summit; but it is sometimes
straight and filiform, at others oblong or square, at
others again triangular, in several instances three-sided:
in one (<i>Cetonia cruenta</i> F. <i>Genuchus</i> K.) it is, as it were,
broken, the upper part forming nearly a right angle with
the lower; in <i>Cerocoma SchÃ¦fferi</i> it is foliaceous; and it
is occasionally suborbicular: and probably many other
forms might be enumerated.</p>

<p>The <i>Pedicellus</i><a name="FNanchor_1537_1537" id="FNanchor_1537_1537"></a><a href="#Footnote_1537_1537" class="fnanchor">[1537]</a> is the <i>second</i>, and may be deemed the
<i>least conspicuous</i> joint of the antennÃ¦. Though more
slender than the scape, it is generally thicker than that
which immediately follows it. In broken antennÃ¦ it is
the hinge or pivot on which the <i>clavola</i> or upper member
turns: it is usually very short, campanulate or bell-shaped,
or obconical; but in a species of bug (<i>Tetyra</i>,
from New Holland&mdash;<i>T. pedicellata</i> Kirb. MS.) it is
nearly as long as all the rest of the joints taken together.
In those species of <i>Lycus</i>, a genus of beetles related to
the glow-worm, that have flattened antennÃ¦ (as <i>L. reticulatus</i>,
<i>fasciatus</i>, &amp;c.), this joint is almost received into
the socket of the scape, so that their antennÃ¦ appear at
first to have only <i>ten</i> joints, but in those which have
those organs filiform (as <i>L. minutus</i>, <i>Aurora</i>, &amp;c.) it is
more conspicuous.</p>

<p>The <i>Clavola</i><a name="FNanchor_1538_1538" id="FNanchor_1538_1538"></a><a href="#Footnote_1538_1538" class="fnanchor">[1538]</a>, or remaining joints of the antennÃ¦
taken together, constitutes the principal part of the organ,
which, especially at its extremity, exercises its functions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
of touch, or any other sense. The principal variations,
as to form and structure, that occur in this part
will be mentioned in another place. I shall only here
observe, that in many instances the first joint of this part
is longer than the rest; but in <i>Tetyra pedicellata</i> just
mentioned, it is by far the shortest, and shaped like the
pedicel of most insects. In the <i>Libellulina</i>, the Homopterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, and those flies whose antennÃ¦ terminate
in a bristle, the clavolet is represented by the
bristle. But in the flies which have a lateral bristle, on
the last joint, and those with triarticulate antennÃ¦ that
have no bristle, the terminal joint represents it. The
clavolet often terminates in a knob, or in several joints
thicker than that which precedes them. This varies
greatly, not only in its form, but also in the number of
joints of which it is composed. Thus in <i>Paussus</i>, <i>Platypus</i>,
and many <i>CalandrÃ¦</i>, it consists of only a <i>single</i>
joint<a name="FNanchor_1539_1539" id="FNanchor_1539_1539"></a><a href="#Footnote_1539_1539" class="fnanchor">[1539]</a>; in <i>Anthrenus</i>, <i>Ditoma</i>, &amp;c. of <i>two</i>; in <i>Nitidula</i>,
<i>Geotrupes</i>, &amp;c. of <i>three</i><a name="FNanchor_1540_1540" id="FNanchor_1540_1540"></a><a href="#Footnote_1540_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a>; in <i>Tetratoma</i>, the <i>SilphidÃ¦</i>, of
<i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_1541_1541" id="FNanchor_1541_1541"></a><a href="#Footnote_1541_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a>; of <i>five</i> in <i>Scaphidium</i><a name="FNanchor_1542_1542" id="FNanchor_1542_1542"></a><a href="#Footnote_1542_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a>; of <i>six</i> in one species of
<i>Languria</i>, of <i>seven</i> in the common cockchafer (<i>Melolontha
vulgaris</i><a name="FNanchor_1543_1543" id="FNanchor_1543_1543"></a><a href="#Footnote_1543_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a>); of <i>eight</i> in <i>Diaperis Boleti</i>, in which
the whole clavolet forms the club<a name="FNanchor_1544_1544" id="FNanchor_1544_1544"></a><a href="#Footnote_1544_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a>; of <i>nine</i> in <i>Oenas</i>; and
<i>ten</i> in <i>Cerapterus</i><a name="FNanchor_1545_1545" id="FNanchor_1545_1545"></a><a href="#Footnote_1545_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a>. All the above, you will observe, are
<i>beetles</i>. In the other orders there are <i>eleven</i> joints in the
knob of some butterflies; <i>twelve</i> in that of <i>Ascalaphus</i><a name="FNanchor_1546_1546" id="FNanchor_1546_1546"></a><a href="#Footnote_1546_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a>
and <i>Myrmeleon</i>; and lastly, <i>fourteen</i> in <i>Trachelus</i><a name="FNanchor_1547_1547" id="FNanchor_1547_1547"></a><a href="#Footnote_1547_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span></p>

<p>Under <i>structure</i> also, the <i>number</i> of joints of which
antennÃ¦ in general consist, should be considered. If
you examine the insects belonging to the different orders,
you will find remarkable variations in this respect.
Let us run through them:&mdash;In the <i>Coleoptera</i> the natural
number of joints is <i>eleven</i>; but this rule is not
without many exceptions. Thus, many have <i>fewer</i> than
the prescribed number: <i>Paussus</i> has only <i>two</i><a name="FNanchor_1548_1548" id="FNanchor_1548_1548"></a><a href="#Footnote_1548_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a>, <i>Claviger</i>
and <i>Platypus</i> five, <i>Dorcatoma</i> and <i>Calandra</i> eight<a name="FNanchor_1549_1549" id="FNanchor_1549_1549"></a><a href="#Footnote_1549_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a>,
<i>Geniates</i> K. and <i>PhanÃ¦us</i> MacLeay nine<a name="FNanchor_1550_1550" id="FNanchor_1550_1550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1550_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a>, and lastly
<i>Melolontha ten</i><a name="FNanchor_1551_1551" id="FNanchor_1551_1551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1551_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a>. Others, again, have <i>more</i> than eleven
joints: <i>Cebrio grandis</i>, <i>Chrysomela stolida</i>, some <i>SaperdÃ¦</i>,
and several others, have <i>twelve</i>. In <i>Prionus imbricornis</i>
the female has <i>nineteen</i>, and the male <i>twenty</i><a name="FNanchor_1552_1552" id="FNanchor_1552_1552"></a><a href="#Footnote_1552_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a>. <i>Rhipicera
marginata</i> has <i>thirty-two</i>; and in a New Holland
species of this genus I counted <i>thirty-eight</i>. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>
I can trace no general law in this respect. In
<i>Locusta</i> Leach in some species you may count <i>fourteen</i>
joints, in others <i>sixteen</i>, and in others <i>twenty-five</i>. In
one, which appears to be a pupa, I found only <i>thirteen</i>.
In <i>Mantis</i> they exceed <i>thirty</i>; but in <i>Blatta</i>, from between
<i>thirty</i> and <i>forty</i>, they reach nearly <i>one hundred and fifty</i>;
often varying in number in different individuals of the
same species. The order <i>Hemiptera</i> exhibits two peculiar
types of antennÃ¦, which, with some exceptions, distinguish
the two natural sections into which M. Latreille
has judiciously divided it. In the <i>Heteropterous</i> section
they are <i>without</i> a bristle at their end; and in the <i>Homopterous</i>
one, with the exception of <i>Aphis</i>, <i>Thrips</i>, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
they <i>have</i> one. In the genera of both these tribes, the
number of joints varies in these organs. Thus, exclusive
of the seta, in <i>Flata</i> and <i>Cixius</i> there are only <i>two</i>
joints; in <i>Galgulus</i>, <i>Fulgora</i>, and <i>Cercopis</i>, there are
<i>three</i>; in <i>LygÃ¦us</i>, <i>Coreus</i>, &amp;c. there are <i>four</i>; in <i>Tetyra</i>,
<i>Pentatoma</i>, <i>Tettigonia</i>, there are <i>five</i><a name="FNanchor_1554_1554" id="FNanchor_1554_1554"></a><a href="#Footnote_1554_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a>; in <i>Aleyrodes</i> there
are <i>six</i>; in <i>Aphis seven</i>; in <i>Thrips eight</i>; in <i>Psylla ten</i>,
the last of which is terminated by two bristles<a name="FNanchor_1555_1555" id="FNanchor_1555_1555"></a><a href="#Footnote_1555_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a>; and in
<i>Coccus eleven</i>. The <i>Neuroptera</i> order, as it stands at
present, is regulated by no general rule with regard to
the number of joints in the antennÃ¦ of the insects that
compose it. Several types of form in these organs distinguish
its discordant tribes. The <i>first</i> is that of the <i>EphemerÃ¦</i>,
in which the antennÃ¦ consist of two short joints,
crowned by a short, tapering, <i>unjointed</i> bristle. The <i>second</i>
is that of the <i>Libellulina</i>, similar to the above, but with a
<i>jointed</i> bristle. The <i>third</i> is that of <i>Psocus</i>, in which the
antenna has two short thick joints at the base, terminated
by a long filiform bristle, consisting of seven or eight
joints, and finer than a hair. Perhaps these three may
be regarded as belonging to a common type. The <i>fourth</i>
type is presented by the short filiform antennÃ¦ of <i>Termes</i>;
the <i>fifth</i> by the setaceous ones of <i>Corydalis</i>, <i>Hemerobius</i>,
&amp;c.; and the <i>sixth</i> and last by the clavate and
capitate ones of <i>Myrmeleon</i> and <i>Ascalaphus</i>. In the
<i>Lepidoptera</i> and <i>Trichoptera</i> orders the antennÃ¦, though
varying in their general form in the three tribes of which
LinnÃ© formed his genera <i>Papilio</i>, <i>Sphinx</i>, and <i>PhalÃ¦na</i>,
with the exception of <i>Hepialus</i>, in which the joints are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
few, are always <i>multiarticulate</i>:&mdash;we will therefore, without
further delay, proceed to the <i>Hymenoptera</i>. In Latreille's
tribe <i>Aculeata</i> the general rule is, that the females
shall have <i>twelve</i> joints and the males <i>thirteen</i>.
In his <i>Ichneumonides</i> the law seems to be, that the antennÃ¦
shall be multiarticulate and setaceous; but in most
of the other tribes of the order, even those that in other
respects are most nearly related,&mdash;as in his <i>TenthredinetÃ¦</i>,&mdash;the
number of joints of these organs varies without
end. Thus in <i>Hylotoma</i> there are only <i>three</i> joints<a name="FNanchor_1556_1556" id="FNanchor_1556_1556"></a><a href="#Footnote_1556_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a>;
in <i>Cimbex lÃ¦ta</i><a name="FNanchor_1557_1557" id="FNanchor_1557_1557"></a><a href="#Footnote_1557_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> <i>five</i>; in <i>C. axillaris</i> and <i>Perga</i> Leach<a name="FNanchor_1558_1558" id="FNanchor_1558_1558"></a><a href="#Footnote_1558_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a>,
six: and so on to twenty-five or more<a name="FNanchor_1559_1559" id="FNanchor_1559_1559"></a><a href="#Footnote_1559_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a>. The same fluctuation
in this respect runs throughout the rest of the
order. In the <i>Diptera</i> there are two general types of
antennÃ¦:&mdash;those of the <i>TipulariÃ¦</i> Latr., consisting usually
of from <i>fourteen</i> to <i>sixteen</i> joints, in the males often
resembling beautiful plumes; and those of the remainder
of the order, in which they do not exceed <i>three</i> joints<a name="FNanchor_1560_1560" id="FNanchor_1560_1560"></a><a href="#Footnote_1560_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a>:
though the last, or <i>patella</i>, is often further divided into
obsolete or indistinct ones<a name="FNanchor_1561_1561" id="FNanchor_1561_1561"></a><a href="#Footnote_1561_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a>. These antennÃ¦ may be
further subdivided into <i>filatÃ¦</i> and <i>aristatÃ¦</i>, or those
without and those with a bristle, either lateral or terminal.</p>

<p>The <i>clothing</i> of antennÃ¦ also merits attention, since it
is often not a little remarkable. By clothing I understand
the <i>down</i> or <i>hairs</i> of every kind with which they
are either generally or partially covered. A great number
of filiform and setaceous antennÃ¦ of Predaceous beetles
(<i>Cicindela</i> L., <i>Carabus</i> L.) have the first two, three, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
four joints naked, and the rest covered with a fine down.
In insects that have a knob at the end of these organs,
whether lamellated or perfoliate, this down is often confined
to it, or to its intermediate joints, and seems intermixed
with nervous papillÃ¦. These are particularly visible
in the flabellate antennÃ¦ of <i>Rhipicera</i>, <i>Lampyris
Latreillii</i><a name="FNanchor_1562_1562" id="FNanchor_1562_1562"></a><a href="#Footnote_1562_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a>, <i>Elater flabellicornis</i><a name="FNanchor_1563_1563" id="FNanchor_1563_1563"></a><a href="#Footnote_1563_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a>, &amp;c. covering both surfaces
of the processes of the joints. In some male bees
these papillÃ¦ are inclosed in hexagonal spaces into which
the antennÃ¦ are marked out<a name="FNanchor_1564_1564" id="FNanchor_1564_1564"></a><a href="#Footnote_1564_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a>. It is to be observed,
that in many antennÃ¦ the joints of the clavolet have one
or two bristles or more at their apex, one above perhaps,
and one below; the lower angle in those of the
serrated antennÃ¦ of <i>Elater</i> is usually so furnished, and
sometimes the upper. In many Capricorn-beetles and
various insects the antennÃ¦ are clothed, instead of down,
with stiffish hairs or short bristles. Other insects have
these organs, at least the clavolet, beset with longer hairs
standing out from them on all sides: of this kind are
those of a singular beetle (<i>Sarrotrium muticum</i>) sometimes
found in this country<a name="FNanchor_1565_1565" id="FNanchor_1565_1565"></a><a href="#Footnote_1565_1565" class="fnanchor">[1565]</a>. Again, there are some
that have only their underside bearded with longer hairs;
as <i>Lamia curculionoides</i>, <i>speculifera</i> K., and other Capricorns<a name="FNanchor_1566_1566" id="FNanchor_1566_1566"></a><a href="#Footnote_1566_1566" class="fnanchor">[1566]</a>.
In another of this tribe, <i>Saperda hirsuticornis</i>,
the three intermediate joints are ornamented with
branches of long black hairs, which give them an elegant
and feathery appearance<a name="FNanchor_1567_1567" id="FNanchor_1567_1567"></a><a href="#Footnote_1567_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a>. In <i>Callichroma alpina</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
apex of the slate-coloured joints of its antennÃ¦ is bearded
with black hairs. In <i>Lamia reticulata</i>, and <i>Saperda
fasciculata</i> and <i>plumigera</i>, all also Capricorns, a single
bunch of hairs, resembling the brush of a bottle-cleaner,
signalizes the middle of the antenna<a name="FNanchor_1568_1568" id="FNanchor_1568_1568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1568_1568" class="fnanchor">[1568]</a>: in <i>Saperda scopulicornis</i>
K. this is star-shaped<a name="FNanchor_1569_1569" id="FNanchor_1569_1569"></a><a href="#Footnote_1569_1569" class="fnanchor">[1569]</a>. Sometimes the <i>scape</i>
is externally bearded, as in <i>Trox</i>, a beetle found in horns
and bones; and in many other Lamellicorns<a name="FNanchor_1570_1570" id="FNanchor_1570_1570"></a><a href="#Footnote_1570_1570" class="fnanchor">[1570]</a>. In this
last tribe the two exterior leaves of the knob of the antennÃ¦
are often set with short bristles<a name="FNanchor_1571_1571" id="FNanchor_1571_1571"></a><a href="#Footnote_1571_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a>; and in a minute
beetle called by De Geer <i>Dermestes atomarius</i>, the hairs
of this part are said to form a brush<a name="FNanchor_1572_1572" id="FNanchor_1572_1572"></a><a href="#Footnote_1572_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a>.</p>

<p>When insects, I mean more particularly <i>Coleoptera</i>,
are about to move from any station where they have
been at rest, the first thing they usually do, before they
set a step, is to bring forward and <i>expand</i> their antennÃ¦,
which have either been carefully laid up in a cavity fitted
to receive them, or back upon the body: if they terminate
in a lamellated knob, they separate the lamellÃ¦ as
far as possible from each other; or if it is perfoliate, the
joints of it mutually recede. The object of this is evidently
to collect notices from the atmosphere, since the
papillose part of these joints cannot be applied to surfaces.
When the animal begins to move, in many cases
the antennÃ¦ do the same, and continue their <i>motion</i> till
it stops and returns to a state of repose. In the parasitic
tribes of the <i>Hymenoptera</i> (<i>Ichneumon</i> L.) they are kept
in an almost constant vibration. Many other insects
move them in all directions without any order or regularity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
and others, when they elevate one depress the
other, and so proceed as if balancing themselves by
means of these organs like a rope-dancer. I have before
stated to you how by motions of their antennÃ¦, ants and
bees communicate their wants or discoveries to each
other, or make inquiry concerning any thing they wish
to know<a name="FNanchor_1573_1573" id="FNanchor_1573_1573"></a><a href="#Footnote_1573_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a>. But as I shall have occasion to make some
further remarks upon this subject, when the senses of
insects are under discussion, I shall for the present take
my leave of it.</p>

<p>I shall conclude what I have to communicate to you
relative to the organs of which we are treating, with a
few observations with respect to their <i>station</i> when the
insect <i>reposes</i>. In the Capricorn-beetles, <i>Eucera</i> and
other insects with <i>long</i> antennÃ¦, they are merely turned
back or on one side with no particular cavity for their reception
when unemployed, but probably the apex passes
under the body. In the Predaceous and Darkling beetles
(<i>Carabus</i> L., <i>Tenebrio</i> L.) their station is usually under
the sides of the <i>prothorax</i>, and in the Tortoise beetles
(<i>Cassida</i>), under its anterior margin. In the Elastic
beetles (<i>Elater</i>) they are received into a groove between
the under margin of that part and the fore-breast (<i>antepectus</i>).
In <i>Anthrenus</i>, when the animal reposes or
counterfeits death, the antennÃ¦ are concealed in a cavity
of the underside of the <i>prothorax</i>, at right angles
with the throat<a name="FNanchor_1574_1574" id="FNanchor_1574_1574"></a><a href="#Footnote_1574_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a>. In the kindred genus <i>Byrrhus</i>, another
simulator of death, a large cavity is excavated under the
same part, to receive both the forelegs and antennÃ¦, a
narrow space being left between the angle of the <i>prothorax</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
and fore-breast exactly admitting the base of the
latter, which are quite concealed under the former. In
<i>Cryptocephalus</i> and <i>Chlamys</i>, kindred beetles, when at
rest they are withdrawn, except their scape and pedicel,
with the head within the cavity of the <i>prothorax</i>. In
others they are turned under the head, without any particular
cavity for their reception; as in many moths,
<i>Apion</i>, &amp;c. In most of the Lamellicorn beetles their station
is in the cavity formed by the eye and the throat,
the knob forming an angle with the rest of the antenna.
In <i>Heterocerus</i> they follow the contour of the eye<a name="FNanchor_1575_1575" id="FNanchor_1575_1575"></a><a href="#Footnote_1575_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a>. In
<i>Brentus</i>, a genus of weevils remarkably long and slender,
they are turned back and received by a slight longitudinal
cavity of the rostrum; but in those of this tribe
(<i>Curculio</i> L.) in which the clavolet forms an angle with
the long scape, this latter part, bending back, is laid up
in an oblique channel of that part; and the former,
pointing in the contrary direction, is folded upon it. In
many flies (<i>MuscidÃ¦</i>) a vertical frontal cavity receives
the antennÃ¦, which point downwards during repose<a name="FNanchor_1576_1576" id="FNanchor_1576_1576"></a><a href="#Footnote_1576_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a>.
<i>Cryptocerus</i>, a very remarkable ant, has on its head a
singular square plate, the sides of which form a deep
longitudinal cavity: in this cavity the antennÃ¦, quite
concealed, repose in safety. A cavity equally remarkable
is exhibited by the water-scorpions, particularly
<i>Belostoma</i>, in which is a <i>very</i> deep kidney-shaped box,
between the eye and throat, to receive and defend its
singular antennÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_1577_1577" id="FNanchor_1577_1577"></a><a href="#Footnote_1577_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a>; which, when they are reposing, is
closed by the exterior harder joints, and from which it
seems as if they turned out, like a sentinel out of his box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
In some aquatic genera of beetles, as <i>Gyrinus</i>, <i>Parnus</i>,
&amp;c. they are withdrawn within a lateral cavity of the
same part, and are defended from the water externally
by the auricle at their base<a name="FNanchor_1578_1578" id="FNanchor_1578_1578"></a><a href="#Footnote_1578_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a>. The flabellated and lamellated
antennÃ¦, previous to their being folded for repose,
close all their plates; which in action are as widely
expanded as possible, so as to form a knob; and in some
the middle piece is entirely concealed, as if in a box.
In broken antennÃ¦, or those in which the clavolet forms
an angle with the scape, the former is folded upon the
latter, with its point downwards.</p>


<p>II. <i>Subfacies.</i>&mdash;Having dispatched the <i>Facies</i>, or <i>upper</i>
side of the head, I am next to consider the <i>Subfacies</i>,
or <i>under</i> side: but as the principal parts that occupy
this side have been already considered, I shall have
no occasion to detain you long.</p>

<p>i. <i>Jugulum</i><a name="FNanchor_1579_1579" id="FNanchor_1579_1579"></a><a href="#Footnote_1579_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a>.&mdash;This part, which may be regarded as
analogous to the throat in vertebrate animals, lies between
the cheeks; from which it may usually be distinguished
by being more lubricous and tumid, and often separated
by an impressed line. It is particularly conspicuous and
elevated in the Lamellicorn beetles, and calculated by its
lubricity for easy motion in the lower side of the cavity
of the chest. Its apex is the base in which the <i>mentum</i>
sits. It is not necessary to enlarge further upon it, as it
seldom exhibits striking characters.</p>


<p>III. <i>Collum</i><a name="FNanchor_1580_1580" id="FNanchor_1580_1580"></a><a href="#Footnote_1580_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a>.&mdash;In a large proportion of insects the
head inosculates in the trunk without the intervention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
of a neck, or a constriction of the head behind. In the
Orders <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Trichoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
and <i>Diptera</i>, no instance of it that I recollect occurs:
in the <i>Coleoptera</i> there are many. In the Predaceous
beetles, though several have no distinct neck, yet
others, as <i>Anthia</i>, &amp;c. have a short and thick one; and
some few, as <i>Colliuris</i>, <i>Agra</i>, &amp;c. one more pronounced.
Latreille has named a tribe in this Order <i>Trachelides</i>,
from the circumstance of their having a neck: in this
tribe you will find the blister-beetles (<i>Cantharis</i> and <i>Mylabris</i>)
both of the moderns and the ancients. In the
<i>Hemiptera</i> order the water-scorpions <i>Nepa</i>, &amp;c. have a
thick short neck; and <i>Zelus</i>, (a kind of bug,) one longer
and more slender; and, like <i>Raphidia</i>, the snake's-head
fly, which is similarly circumstanced, has the air of a
serpent. Other <i>Neuroptera</i>, likewise, have a neck; as
<i>Hemerobius</i>, <i>Corydalis</i>, &amp;c. This part presents no other
features that merit notice.</p>


<p>IV. <i>Myoglyphides</i><a name="FNanchor_1581_1581" id="FNanchor_1581_1581"></a><a href="#Footnote_1581_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a>.&mdash;The <i>Myoglyphides</i>, or muscle-notches,
are sinuses, some shallow and some deeper, in
the posterior margin of the upper side of the head, to
which the levator muscles are affixed. They seem principally
confined to the <i>Coleoptera</i>; though, in some
cases at least, they may be traced in the Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>. These notches vary in number and depth
in different insects. Thus in <i>Buprestis</i> there is only <i>one</i>
deep one<a name="FNanchor_1582_1582" id="FNanchor_1582_1582"></a><a href="#Footnote_1582_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a>: in <i>Copris</i> there are <i>two</i> shallow ones, in a
deep sinus separated by a small prominence<a name="FNanchor_1583_1583" id="FNanchor_1583_1583"></a><a href="#Footnote_1583_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a>: in <i>Elater</i>
and <i>Lamia</i> there are also two not in a sinus; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
<i>Calandra Palmarum</i> there are four, two on each side, with
a prominent lobe between them<a name="FNanchor_1584_1584" id="FNanchor_1584_1584"></a><a href="#Footnote_1584_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a>. To each of these
notches, at its under margin, below the ligament that
unites the occiput to the trunk, a muscle to raise the
head is usually attached.</p>

<h3><i>EXTERNAL ANATOMY OF INSECTS</i>,
CONTINUED.</h3>

<h5>THE TRUNK, AND ITS PARTS AND ORGANS.</h5>


<p>As the <i>head</i> of insects is the principal seat of the organs
of <i>sensation</i>, so is the <i>trunk</i> of those of <i>motion</i>; and in it
are contained the muscles by which they are moved: it
may therefore be regarded as the great centre of motion,
and as the main support and prop of the two other primary
sections of the body&mdash;the head and abdomen, between
which it is situated&mdash;it may be deemed the most
important part of the insect, the key-stone of the whole
structure. In treating upon it, for the greater clearness,
I shall consider its <i>substance</i>, <i>general form</i>, <i>proportions</i>,
<i>composition</i>, <i>internal processes</i>, and <i>members</i>. It will first,
however, be necessary to assign my reasons for the nomenclature
of its parts that I have adopted.</p>

<p>Had the entomological world been universally agreed
upon this subject, and there was an established system
of Orismology<a name="FNanchor_1585_1585" id="FNanchor_1585_1585"></a><a href="#Footnote_1585_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a>, I should have proposed no alteration
without great reluctance, and the fullest conviction of the
absolute necessity of some change; but as the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
of language in our science is still unsettled, and different
terms are used by different writers, there seems full liberty
left to me to select those that appear upon the
whole most appropriate; and where proper and significant
terms seem wanting, to invent new ones. M. Latreille,
in a late Essay<a name="FNanchor_1586_1586" id="FNanchor_1586_1586"></a><a href="#Footnote_1586_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a>, has proposed many changes of
this kind, and seems to hesitate concerning the adoption
of some of those recently coined in France for the parts
of the trunk<a name="FNanchor_1587_1587" id="FNanchor_1587_1587"></a><a href="#Footnote_1587_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a>; it may therefore, I think, be permitted
me to labour a little in this hitherto imperfectly cultured
field, and to suggest such improvements as the subject
may seem to require or admit.</p>

<p>LinnÃ© called the part we are now considering the
<i>trunk</i>, its upper-side he usually denominated the <i>thorax</i>,
and its under-side the <i>breast</i>: he notices also the <i>scutellum</i>
and <i>sternum</i><a name="FNanchor_1588_1588" id="FNanchor_1588_1588"></a><a href="#Footnote_1588_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a>. As the <i>prothorax</i> and <i>scutellum</i> are
the only <i>apparent</i> parts of the back of the trunk in his
first Orders (<i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Hemiptera</i> L.), the rest being
covered, in noticing these he puts the part for the whole,
calling the <i>prothorax</i> the <i>thorax</i>, but which strictly was
not synonymous with what he called by the same name
in the other Orders. LinnÃ©'s phraseology with regard to
the trunk of insects was adopted by Fabricius and other
Entomologists, till Illiger employed the term <i>thorax</i> to
designate the whole of the trunk<a name="FNanchor_1589_1589" id="FNanchor_1589_1589"></a><a href="#Footnote_1589_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a>, calling the upper part
<i>thorax superior</i> and the lower <i>thorax inferior</i>. M. De
Blainville, M. Latreille, and other French writers, improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
upon this, naming the upper part the back (<i>dorsum</i>),
and the lower the breast (<i>pectus</i>); and dividing the
trunk, or according to them <i>thorax</i>, into three sections,
each bearing a pair of legs. But I see no sufficient reason
for this alteration&mdash;the terms <i>trunk</i>, <i>thorax</i>, and <i>breast</i>,
in the common acceptation are well understood, and lead
to no confusion or glaring impropriety; I shall therefore
adhere to the old phraseology, especially as French Entomologists
in popular language still do the same.</p>

<p>As to the division of the trunk into segments by M. Latreille
and others, it has been regarded as consisting of
<i>three</i> primary ones, which have been called in the order
of their occurrence, reckoning from the head&mdash;<i>prothorax</i>,
<i>mesothorax</i>, <i>metathorax</i>. The first of these segments,
however&mdash;and the learned Entomologist just named seems
to hint as much<a name="FNanchor_1590_1590" id="FNanchor_1590_1590"></a><a href="#Footnote_1590_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a>&mdash;is usually more distinct from the other
two, than they are from each other. If this idea be correct,
the trunk is properly resolvable into <i>two</i> primary
segments, the first bearing the arms or fore-legs, and the
other the proper legs and the organs of flight. M. Chabrier
calls the latter <i>tronc alifÃ¨re</i>, or wing-trunk;&mdash;a
happy term, which I have adopted and latinized, calling
it the alitrunk (<i>alitruncus</i>): the first segment, because
it bears the fore-legs, I have named manitrunk (<i>manitruncus</i>).
I adopt likewise the terms above mentioned,
<i>prothorax</i>, <i>mesothorax</i>, <i>metathorax</i>, to signify the three
segments into which the thorax of LinnÃ©, or the <i>upper</i>
side of the trunk, is resolvable; and those of the breast
I denominate <i>antepectus</i>, <i>medipectus</i>, and <i>postpectus</i>. If
terms be thought necessary to designate the two intire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
segments into which the alitrunk is resolvable, the first
may be the meditrunk (<i>meditruncus</i>), and the other the
potrunk (<i>potruncus</i>).</p>


<p>I. <i>Substance.</i>&mdash;With regard to its <i>substance</i>, the trunk
in general is softer than the head, and harder than the
abdomen, especially as to its upper surface; but in some
cases, where it is not protected by the elytra, as in the
rove-beetles (<i>Staphylinus</i> L.), the abdomen appears as
hard as the trunk. Though usually not very different
from the elytra in this respect, in <i>Meloe</i>, <i>Lytta</i>, and other
vesicatory beetles, it is of a firmer consistence.</p>


<p>II. <i>General Form.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order the only
part of the trunk that is visible on its upper-side is the
<i>prothorax</i>: the <i>mesothorax</i>, with the exception of the <i>scutellum</i>,
and the <i>metathorax</i>, being entirely concealed by
it and the elytra; so that, with regard to <i>shape</i>, it may
nearly be considered as merging in the <i>prothorax</i>. Below
it is more visible, and may be stated as more or less
quadrangular; in oblong beetles inclining to a parallelogram,
and in shorter or hemispherical ones to a square.
In the majority it is more convex below than above, except
in the case of the hemispherical or gibbous beetles (<i>Coccinella</i>,
<i>Erotylus</i>, &amp;c.), in which the under-side is flat and
the upper-side very convex. In the <i>Diurnal Lepidoptera</i>
the trunk approaches to a cubical shape, in the
<i>Nocturnal</i> it is more spherical. A similar difference obtains
in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>: in the bees,
wasps and flies, the trunk approaching to the figure of
a sphere; in the ants, <i>ScoliÃ¦</i>, crane-flies, &amp;c. to that of
a cube. The upper part of it in many <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
female ants, &amp;c. is very elevated, forming an arch, and
sloping towards the abdomen. In general it may be observed
with respect to the remaining Orders, that the
form of the trunk merges in that of the whole body, the
tendency of which is often to a three-sided figure.</p>


<p>III. <i>Proportions.</i>&mdash;The trunk is usually longer and
larger than the head and longer than the abdomen, but
not wider: but there are exceptions to both these rules.
In <i>Colliuris</i>, <i>Mantis</i>, &amp;c., it is more <i>slender</i>; and in <i>Atta
megacephala</i> and some neuter ants, it is <i>shorter</i> than the
<i>head</i>; in <i>Atractocerus</i>, many <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, <i>Phasma</i>, the
<i>Libellulina</i>, the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and various <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
it is shorter, and in the <i>MantidÃ¦</i> more <i>slender</i> than the
<i>abdomen</i>. The greatest disproportion between it and the
last part is exhibited by the genus <i>Evania</i>, parasitic
upon the <i>BlattÃ¦</i>, in which the abdomen appears merely
as a minute and insignificant appendage of the trunk.
The vertical diameter of this part, almost without exception,
is greater than that of either head or abdomen.
When we consider that it contains the muscles that move
both the organs of flight and the legs, we see clearly the
reason why the <span class="smcap">Creator</span> gave it greater volume.</p>


<p>IV. <i>Composition.</i>&mdash;I lately intimated to you that the
trunk, though resolvable into <i>three</i> segments, in most
cases properly consists of only <i>two</i> primary ones. Whoever
examines the perfect insects of every Order, except
the <i>Aptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1591_1591" id="FNanchor_1591_1591"></a><a href="#Footnote_1591_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a>, will find this distinction strongly pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
out, not only by the different direction of the first pair of
legs from that of the two last, but also in a large proportion
by a deep incisure; and in all it is further manifested by
the anterior segment having a motion distinct
from that of the rest of the trunk, and separating readily
from it; and this not only where it is large, as in insects
that have a thoracic shield, but also in those in which
the <i>prothorax</i> is less apparent: whereas the other two
pedigerous segments have little or no distinct motion,
will not readily separate from each other, and in some
cases exhibit no pectoral suture between them. Sometimes,
however, these two last segments are more prominently
distinguished: in <i>Lytta</i>, <i>Mylabris</i>, and other vesicatory
beetles, they are separated below by an incisure,
or rather the first or mid-leg segment, is not nearly so
elevated as that of the hind-legs. In some ants (<i>Atta</i>
Latr.), in the neuters, there is no distinction of segments
in the trunk; but in others (<i>Formica</i> Latr.) it follows the
general law, and consists of three. In the <i>Arachnida</i>,
with the exception of <i>Galeodes</i>, in which the head is distinct,
and the three segments of the trunk may be traced,
these parts together form only a single segment. Induced
by these reasons, I consider the trunk as consisting
in general of two <i>primary</i> segments, the <i>manitrunk</i>
and <i>alitrunk</i>: the latter resolvable into two <i>secondary</i>
ones.</p>

<p>* <i>Manitruncus</i><a name="FNanchor_1592_1592" id="FNanchor_1592_1592"></a><a href="#Footnote_1592_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a>.&mdash;The manitrunk, then, is the anterior
section of the trunk, which bears the arms and contains
the muscles that move them. This part has free
motion, or a motion independent of that of the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
trunk. This indeed seems a necessary result of the direction
and uses of the arms. It consists of an upper
and lower part&mdash;the <i>prothorax</i> and <i>antepectus</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Prothorax</i><a name="FNanchor_1593_1593" id="FNanchor_1593_1593"></a><a href="#Footnote_1593_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a>.&mdash;The upper part of the manitrunk in
the <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>, and <i>Hemiptera</i>, is by far the
most conspicuous part of the trunk, but in the other Orders
it is less so. With respect to it, insects may be divided
into two classes&mdash;those that have and those that
have not a <i>prothorax</i>. In the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order it is remarkable
both for size and variations in its shape and
sculpture. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, though less various, it
is almost equally conspicuous, especially in <i>Blatta</i>. In
the <i>Homopterous</i> section of the <i>Hemiptera</i>, in many genera
it has become extremely short; while in the <i>Heteropterous</i>
section its dimensions are not much reduced.
In the majority of the <i>Neuroptera</i>, likewise, it is comparatively
large; in the <i>Libellulina</i> much shorter, and in
the <i>Trichoptera</i> and <i>Lepidoptera</i> nearly evanescent<a name="FNanchor_1594_1594" id="FNanchor_1594_1594"></a><a href="#Footnote_1594_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a>.&mdash;In
the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>, with very few exceptions,
the thoracic shield altogether disappears, at least
if I am correct in an idea, which I shall hereafter explain,
that the <i>collar</i> usually regarded as the analogue of the
<i>prothorax</i>, is really a part of the alitrunk. In these last
Orders, though there is no true <i>prothorax</i>, the manitrunk
still remains under the form of an <i>antepectus</i>,
bearing the fore-legs, and containing the muscles that
move them.</p>

<p>The prothorax of insects may in general be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
with respect to its <i>parts</i>, <i>margin</i>, <i>appendages</i>, <i>shape</i>,
<i>sculpture</i>, <i>clothing</i>, and <i>proportions</i>.</p>

<p>1. The <i>prothorax</i>, regarded as a whole, distinct from
the <i>antepectus</i> or fore-breast, consists commonly of <i>two</i>
pieces&mdash;the <i>shield</i>, or upper part<a name="FNanchor_1595_1595" id="FNanchor_1595_1595"></a><a href="#Footnote_1595_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a>, and the <i>ora</i>, or under
part<a name="FNanchor_1596_1596" id="FNanchor_1596_1596"></a><a href="#Footnote_1596_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a>. In the shield you are to observe its <i>apex</i><a name="FNanchor_1597_1597" id="FNanchor_1597_1597"></a><a href="#Footnote_1597_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a>, <i>base</i><a name="FNanchor_1598_1598" id="FNanchor_1598_1598"></a><a href="#Footnote_1598_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a>,
<i>sides</i><a name="FNanchor_1599_1599" id="FNanchor_1599_1599"></a><a href="#Footnote_1599_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a>, <i>limb</i><a name="FNanchor_1600_1600" id="FNanchor_1600_1600"></a><a href="#Footnote_1600_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a>, and <i>disk</i><a name="FNanchor_1601_1601" id="FNanchor_1601_1601"></a><a href="#Footnote_1601_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a>. The <i>apex</i> is the part next the
<i>head</i>; the <i>base</i> that next the <i>abdomen</i>; the <i>limb</i> the <i>circumference</i>,
and the <i>disk</i> the <i>central</i> part. In many <i>Orthoptera</i>
and Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, the shield appears
further to consist of two pieces, an anterior and
posterior one. The <i>ora</i> is a continuation of the shield
below the lateral margin, turned downwards and inwards
towards the fore-breast and the legs, but separated
from the former in most cases by a suture, as in <i>Carabus</i>
L.; and in others merely by an impressed line, as in
<i>Blaps</i> F.; but in <i>Curculio</i> and <i>Cerambyx</i> L., &amp;c. there is
no ora, the shield being without a lateral margin, and
forming one piece with the <i>antepectus</i>. The part we are
now considering varies in different genera. Sometimes
it is very <i>narrow</i>, as in <i>Scarites</i>; at others very <i>broad</i>, as
in <i>Buprestis</i>, <i>Nepa</i>, &amp;c. In <i>Lampyris</i>, except <i>L. italica</i>,
and affinities, it projects posteriorly into a <i>lobe</i> or tooth,
which forms a right angle with the rest of the <i>ora</i>, and
becomes the lower part of the cavity that receives the
head; and in <i>Dermestes</i> this part is excavated into an
anterior and posterior one which admits the antennÃ¦ and
arms when folded for repose.</p>

<p>2. The <i>margin</i> of the <i>prothorax</i> is a ridge, either defining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
its sides or whole circumference. In many cases
this margin is broad and dilated, but in others it is merely
a thread or bead that separates the shield from the <i>ora</i>.
Though generally terminating the upper surface, it sometimes,
as in <i>Staphylinus</i>, dips below it. In many insects,
however, as I just observed, the thoracic shield has no
lateral margin whatever.</p>

<p>3. Various and singular are the <i>appendages</i> with which
the <i>prothorax</i> of numerous insects is furnished. Many of
these are <i>sexual</i> distinctions, and have been before described
to you<a name="FNanchor_1602_1602" id="FNanchor_1602_1602"></a><a href="#Footnote_1602_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a>; but there are others common to both
sexes, the most remarkable of which I shall notice.&mdash;Some
are distinguished by a long <i>horn</i> which overhangs
the head, as <i>Membracis cultrata</i>, <i>ensata</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1603_1603" id="FNanchor_1603_1603"></a><a href="#Footnote_1603_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a>; in others
it stands upright, as in <i>Centrotus spinosus</i><a name="FNanchor_1604_1604" id="FNanchor_1604_1604"></a><a href="#Footnote_1604_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a>; <i>C. Taurus</i>
has a pair of thoracic horns like those of a bull,
only dorsal<a name="FNanchor_1605_1605" id="FNanchor_1605_1605"></a><a href="#Footnote_1605_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a>; in <i>Ledra aurita</i> they are flat, and represent
ears<a name="FNanchor_1606_1606" id="FNanchor_1606_1606"></a><a href="#Footnote_1606_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a>; in some species of <i>Tingis</i> (<i>T. Echii</i>, <i>Pyri</i>, &amp;c.)
a kind of reticulated hood, resembling lace, is elevated
from the anterior part of the <i>prothorax</i>, which receives
and shelters the head<a name="FNanchor_1607_1607" id="FNanchor_1607_1607"></a><a href="#Footnote_1607_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a>. In <i>Centrotus globularis</i> and <i>clavatus</i>
F., especially the former, the part in question is armed
by a most singular and wonderful apparatus of balls and
spines,&mdash;in one case standing erect<a name="FNanchor_1608_1608" id="FNanchor_1608_1608"></a><a href="#Footnote_1608_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a>, and in the other being
horizontal<a name="FNanchor_1609_1609" id="FNanchor_1609_1609"></a><a href="#Footnote_1609_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a>,&mdash;which gives these animals a most extraordinary
appearance. In many of the species here quoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
the <i>prothorax</i> is producted posteriorly into a long scutelliform
horizontal horn, which more or less covers the
wings and abdomen; a circumstance which also distinguishes
the genus <i>Acrydium</i> F. (<i>Tetrix</i> Latr.). This
horn seems to have been sometimes regarded by LinnÃ©
and Fabricius as a real <i>scutellum</i>, and sometimes only as
a process of the prothorax: but that it is merely the
latter will be evident to you, if you examine carefully
any insect furnished with this appendage; for if you remove
that part, you will discover the true scutellum and
other parts of the trunk concealed beneath it. A very remarkable
prothoracic appendage is exhibited by some
species of <i>Mantis</i>. In general the part we are treating
of in this tribe is very slender; but in <i>M. strumaria</i>, <i>gongyloides</i>,
&amp;c., it appears dilated to a vast width, and assumes,
either partially or generally, a subrhomboidal
form; but if it is more closely examined, it will be found
that the form of the <i>prothorax</i> is really similar to that of
the rest of the tribe, but that this part is furnished on
each side, either on its whole length or anteriorly, with a
large membranous flat subtriangular appendage resembling
parchment<a name="FNanchor_1610_1610" id="FNanchor_1610_1610"></a><a href="#Footnote_1610_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a>. Perhaps this kind of sail may be useful
to the animal in flight. In <i>Prionus coriarius</i> &amp;c. its sides
are armed with teeth, and in many <i>LamiÃ¦</i>, <i>Cerambyces</i>, and
other Capricorn beetles, and often in various bugs (<i>Pentatoma</i>
Latr.) with sharp fixed spines. But the <i>prothorax</i>
has <i>moveable</i> as well as <i>fixed</i> appendages; of this
kind are those spines (<i>umbones</i>), whose base is a spherical
boss moving in an <i>acetabulum</i> of the thoracic shield
of the Capricorn subgenus <i>Macropus</i> Thunb. If I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
hazard a conjecture, I should say that these organs were
given to this animal by an all-provident <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, to enable
it to push itself forward, when in the heart of some
tree it emerges from the pupa, that it may escape from
its confinement. Another kind of moveable appendages
are attached to the thorax of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, usually in the
form of a pair of concavo-convex scales covered externally
with a tuft of hairs<a name="FNanchor_1611_1611" id="FNanchor_1611_1611"></a><a href="#Footnote_1611_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a>. M. Chabrier, who examined
these scales in recent insects, describes them as vesicles,
which appeared to him full of a liquid and of air, and capable
of being alternately inflated and rendered flaccid;
he regards them as accessories to a pair of spiracles,
which he looks upon as vocal<a name="FNanchor_1612_1612" id="FNanchor_1612_1612"></a><a href="#Footnote_1612_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a>, opening into the manitrunk
just above the insertion of the arms. These organs
are quite distinct from the <i>tegulÃ¦</i> that cover the
base of the primary wings of insects of this Order<a name="FNanchor_1613_1613" id="FNanchor_1613_1613"></a><a href="#Footnote_1613_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a>, and
are what, borrowing a term from Mouffet<a name="FNanchor_1614_1614" id="FNanchor_1614_1614"></a><a href="#Footnote_1614_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a>, I have called
in the table <i>patagia</i>, or tippets. Under this head I may
include the <i>caruncles</i> at the anterior angles of the <i>prothorax</i>
of a genus of beetles with soft elytra, named by
Fabricius <i>Malachius</i>. When pressed, says De Geer
of these insects, a red inflated soft vesicle, of an irregular
shape, and consisting of three lobes, emerges from
the thorax and from each side of the anterior part of the
abdomen, which re-enters the body when the pressure is
removed<a name="FNanchor_1615_1615" id="FNanchor_1615_1615"></a><a href="#Footnote_1615_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a>. M. Latreille seems to think that these vesicles
have some analogy with the poisers of <i>Diptera</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
the pectens of scorpions; and that they are connected
with the respiration<a name="FNanchor_1616_1616" id="FNanchor_1616_1616"></a><a href="#Footnote_1616_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a>.</p>

<p>4. We are next to say something upon the <i>shape</i> of
the <i>prothorax</i>. The forms of the thoracic shield, especially
in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, are so various, that it would be
endless to aim at particularizing all; but it may be useful
to notice a few of the most remarkable. The prothorax
of <i>Moluris</i>, a darkling-beetle, approaches the
nearest of that of any insect to a spherical form, from its
remarkable convexity; in the wheel-bug (<i>Reduvius serratus</i>)
it is compressed, and longitudinally elevated into
a semicircular serrated crest: it is crested, also, in many
<i>LocustÃ¦</i> and <i>AcridÃ¦</i>, in some having two parallel ridges;
but, generally speaking, its surface is more depressed.
In <i>Necrodes</i> it is nearly circular, in <i>Blatta petiveriana</i>
semicircular, in <i>Nilion</i> and some <i>CoccinellidÃ¦</i> crescent-shaped,
in <i>Carabus</i> obcordate, in <i>Cantharis</i> and <i>Sagra</i>
approaching to a square, in <i>Languria</i> to a parallelogram;
in many <i>CimicidÃ¦</i>, <i>Belostoma</i>, &amp;c., it is triangular, with
the vertex truncated; it is trapezoidal in <i>Elater</i>, in <i>Ateuchus</i>
rather pentagonal, and exhibiting an approach to
six angles in some other beetles<a name="FNanchor_1617_1617" id="FNanchor_1617_1617"></a><a href="#Footnote_1617_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a>: but the prothorax
most singular in form is that of some species of M. Latreille's
genus <i>HelÃ¦us</i><a name="FNanchor_1618_1618" id="FNanchor_1618_1618"></a><a href="#Footnote_1618_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a>, as <i>H. perforatus</i>, <i>Brownii</i>, &amp;c.:
in these its anterior angles are producted, and curving
inwards, lap at the end one over the other, so as to form
a circular orifice for the head, which otherwise would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
quite covered by the shield. Thus the upper portion of
the eyes can see objects above, as well as their lower portion
those below. I might enumerate many other forms,
but these are sufficient to give you some notion of the
variations of this part.</p>

<p>5. The <i>prothorax</i> is equally various in its <i>sculpture</i>;
but since in the Orismological table almost every instance
of it has its place, I shall here only notice it as far as it
is common to the whole tribes, genera, or subgenera.
The <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> of Mr. W. S. MacLeay are distinguished
by a small <i>excavation</i> on each side of this part,
which, as has been before remarked<a name="FNanchor_1619_1619" id="FNanchor_1619_1619"></a><a href="#Footnote_1619_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a>, furnishes an elevated
base for an internal process with which the anterior
<i>coxÃ¦</i> ginglymate. In <i>Onitis</i> and <i>PhanÃ¦us</i>, to these
excavations are superadded a pair impressed in the base
of the <i>prothorax</i>, just above the scutellum; in <i>Carabus</i> L.
a longitudinal channel divides the thoracic shield into
two equal portions; and many genera of that great tribe
have in addition, at the base on each side, one or two
excavations or short furrows. <i>Elophorus</i> F. has on this
part several longitudinal channels, alternately straight
and undulated. Generally speaking, in <i>Carabus</i> L. the
<i>prothorax</i> has no impressed points; but in one or two subgenera
of <i>HarpalidÃ¦</i> (<i>ChlÃ¦nia</i> &amp;c.) it is thickly covered
with them. In numbers of <i>Locusta</i> Leach, the part we
are considering is what LinnÃ© terms <i>cruciate</i>, being divided
into four longitudinal portions by three elevated
lines, the intermediate one being straight, and the lateral
ones diverging from it both at their base and apex, so
as to form a sinus or angle<a name="FNanchor_1620_1620" id="FNanchor_1620_1620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1620_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a>. In certain <i>AcridÃ¦</i> K.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
(<i>Locusta</i> F.) there are only two of these lines or ridges,
but notched or toothed; and in some of the genus first
named only one<a name="FNanchor_1621_1621" id="FNanchor_1621_1621"></a><a href="#Footnote_1621_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a>; in <i>Locusta Dux</i> and affinities the <i>prothorax</i>
has several transverse channels or rather folds<a name="FNanchor_1622_1622" id="FNanchor_1622_1622"></a><a href="#Footnote_1622_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a>,
with corresponding ridges on its internal surface.</p>

<p>6. With respect to the <i>clothing</i> of the <i>prothorax</i>, I have
not much to say: in Coleopterous insects this part is commonly
naked; but in some genera, as <i>Byrrhus</i>, <i>Anthrenus</i>,
<i>Dermestes</i>, and many weevils (<i>Curculio</i> L.) it is partially
or totally covered with hairs or scales. In the other thoracic
Orders it is usually naked, but in some <i>Neuroptera</i>,
the <i>Myrmeleonina</i>, &amp;c., it is hairy; and in the <i>Libellulina</i>
it is fringed posteriorly with hairs.</p>

<p>7. As to its relative <i>proportions</i>, the <i>prothorax</i> is sometimes
rather wider than the rest of the trunk and the
head, as in <i>Onitis</i>, <i>Pasimachus</i>, &amp;c.; it is considerably narrower
in <i>Collyuris</i> and <i>Odacantha</i>; and of the same width
in those <i>ScaritidÃ¦</i> with <i>striated</i> elytra<a name="FNanchor_1623_1623" id="FNanchor_1623_1623"></a><a href="#Footnote_1623_1623" class="fnanchor">[1623]</a>. Again, it is
sometimes of the same width with the elytra, but wider
than the head, as in <i>Hydrophilus</i>, <i>Dytiscus</i>, &amp;c.; in some
instances it is of the same width with the head, and narrower
than the elytra, for instance in <i>Anthia</i> and <i>Brachinus</i>.
In most <i>Coleoptera</i> it is longer than the head
and shorter than the elytra; but in <i>Manticora</i>, the vesicatory
beetles, &amp;c., it is shorter than either. In <i>Gnoma
longicollis</i><a name="FNanchor_1624_1624" id="FNanchor_1624_1624"></a><a href="#Footnote_1624_1624" class="fnanchor">[1624]</a>, it is nearly as long as the elytra; in many
<i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, <i>Atractocerus</i>, &amp;c., longer; in <i>PhanÃ¦us carnifex</i>,
<i>bellicosus</i>, &amp;c., it is longer than the elytra and the
rest of the body. With regard to itself, it is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
very wide in proportion to its length&mdash;<i>Dytiscus</i>, <i>HelÃ¦us</i>;
at others very long in proportion to its width&mdash;<i>Colliuris</i>,
<i>Brentus</i>, <i>Mantis</i>, &amp;c. In <i>Flata</i>, and many other Homopterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, it is extremely short; extremely
long in <i>Gnoma</i>; in <i>Sagra</i> and <i>Donacia</i> its width about
equals its length; in <i>Elater</i>, <i>Dytiscus</i>, and many Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, it is narrowest before; in <i>Languria</i>
it is every where of equal width; in <i>Anthia</i>, <i>Carabus</i>,
&amp;c., it is widest before; and, lastly, in the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>
MacLeay it is usually widest in the middle.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Antepectus</i><a name="FNanchor_1625_1625" id="FNanchor_1625_1625"></a><a href="#Footnote_1625_1625" class="fnanchor">[1625]</a>.&mdash;The <i>antepectus</i>, as was before observed<a name="FNanchor_1626_1626" id="FNanchor_1626_1626"></a><a href="#Footnote_1626_1626" class="fnanchor">[1626]</a>,
in some tribes forms one piece, without any
kind of separation, with the <i>prothorax</i>; but very often
this is not the case. In <i>Carabus</i> L. it occupies almost
the whole under-side of the manitrunk; but in <i>Elater</i>,
in which the <i>ora</i> is very wide, the <i>antepectus</i> is merely
the <i>middle</i> portion of that part. In <i>Carabus</i> F. &amp;c. between
the <i>ora</i> and the base of the arms is a convex triangular
piece, distinguished from the rest of the <i>antepectus</i>
by a spurious suture; and in <i>Pentatoma</i> and other
Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i> a similar piece is observable,
which terminates in a convex bilobed subtriangular
sheath, receiving the base of the clavicle<a name="FNanchor_1627_1627" id="FNanchor_1627_1627"></a><a href="#Footnote_1627_1627" class="fnanchor">[1627]</a>. This piece
seems a prop to that part, and analogous to the <i>scapula</i>
of the <i>medipectus</i> and <i>parapleura</i> of the postpectus. I
shall say no more upon the <i>antepectus</i>, as it is seldom
remarkable. In the mole-cricket, however, one peculiarity
distinguishes it: it is in this of an elastic leathery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
substance, while the <i>prosternum</i> is hard, resembling a
bone. In other instances these parts are both of the
same substance.</p>

<p>1. The <i>sternum</i> or breast-bone of insects consists
mostly of <i>three</i> distinct pieces; in this resembling the
human <i>sternum</i>, which is described by anatomists as
composed originally of <i>three</i> bones<a name="FNanchor_1628_1628" id="FNanchor_1628_1628"></a><a href="#Footnote_1628_1628" class="fnanchor">[1628]</a>. Each of these
pieces is appropriated to a pair of legs, and each of them
at times has been called the <i>sternum</i>: thus in <i>Elater</i> the
<i>prosternum</i>, in the <i>CetoniadÃ¦</i> the <i>mesosternum</i>, and in <i>Hydrophilus</i>
the <i>metasternum</i>, have been distinguished by this
name. Our business is now with the first of these pieces,
the <i>sternum</i> of the <i>antepectus</i> or <i>prosternum</i><a name="FNanchor_1629_1629" id="FNanchor_1629_1629"></a><a href="#Footnote_1629_1629" class="fnanchor">[1629]</a>: this is the
middle longitudinal ridge of the <i>fore-breast</i>, which passes
between the arms, when elevated, extended, or otherwise
remarkable. It is most important in the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order,
to which my remarks upon it will be chiefly confined.
In these it is sometimes an <i>elevation</i>, and sometimes
a <i>horizontal</i> process of the fore-breast. If you
examine the great <i>Hydrophilus</i> (<i>H. piceus</i>), at first you
will think that there is only a single <i>sternum</i> common to
all the legs; but if you look more closely, you will perceive
between the head and the arms a triangular vertical
process, with a longitudinal cavity on its posterior face,
which receives the point of the <i>mesosternum</i> that passes
between the arms<a name="FNanchor_1630_1630" id="FNanchor_1630_1630"></a><a href="#Footnote_1630_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a>: this vertical piece is the real <i>prosternum</i>,
and not the other, which really belongs to the
alitrunk. In this case the elevation of the <i>prosternum</i> is
<i>before</i> the arms; in others it is <i>between</i> them, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
may see in a Chinese chafer (<i>Mimela</i> K.), which imitates
the external appearance of a quite different tribe<a name="FNanchor_1631_1631" id="FNanchor_1631_1631"></a><a href="#Footnote_1631_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a>;
in others again it is <i>behind</i> them, as in most of the Lamellicorn
beetles. In the common dung-chafer (<i>Geotrupes
stercorarius</i>), it is a hairy process, which, when the head
is bent downwards, is received by a deep cavity of the
<i>mesosternum</i>. The <i>DynastidÃ¦</i> MacLeay may always
be known by a columnar <i>prosternum</i> rising vertically between
the arms and the <i>medipectus</i>. Lastly, in other
tribes there is a prosternal elevation both <i>before</i> and <i>behind</i>
the arms, as in <i>Cerambyx thoracicus</i>, <i>dimidiatus</i>, and
affinities. Of the <i>second</i> description, those that have a
less elevated horizontal <i>prosternum</i>, the point in most is
to the <i>anus</i>, but in some to the <i>head</i>: thus in <i>Carabus</i> L.
it is generally a subspathulate flat piece, the point of
which slides over the <i>mesosternum</i>, or covers it; but in
<i>Harpalus megacephalus</i> Latr.<a name="FNanchor_1632_1632" id="FNanchor_1632_1632"></a><a href="#Footnote_1632_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a>, one of this tribe, though
similarly shaped, its point is to the <i>head</i>. These horizontal
<i>prosterna</i> vary in their termination. In that of
<i>Carabus</i> L. the apex is obtuse; in that of <i>Elater</i>, above
described<a name="FNanchor_1633_1633" id="FNanchor_1633_1633"></a><a href="#Footnote_1633_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a>, and <i>Dytiscus</i> it is <i>acute</i>; in <i>Prionus lineatus</i>,
<i>Spencii</i> K., &amp;c., it is <i>bilobed</i>; and in <i>Buprestis variabilis</i>,
<i>attenuata</i>, &amp;c., obsoletely <i>trilobed</i>. With regard to the
other Orders no striking features of this part are observable,
except in some <i>Orthoptera</i>. In <i>Acrida viridissima</i>
K. (<i>Locusta</i> F.) it is represented by two long filiform vertical
processes; and in <i>Locusta</i> Leach by a single conical
horn<a name="FNanchor_1634_1634" id="FNanchor_1634_1634"></a><a href="#Footnote_1634_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a>, mistaken by Lichtenstein for a process of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
throat<a name="FNanchor_1635_1635" id="FNanchor_1635_1635"></a><a href="#Footnote_1635_1635" class="fnanchor">[1635]</a>. In one instance, <i>Gryllotalpa</i>, this part is a long
piece between the arms, shaped like the human thighbone
or <i>tibia</i>, being more slender in the middle and
widest at the ends, and which is of a much harder substance
than the rest of the <i>antepectus</i>, and forms the
lower termination of a singular machine which will before
long be noticed. In many bugs (<i>CimicidÃ¦</i>), instead
of being elevated, the three portions of the <i>sternum</i> are
hollowed out into a longitudinal groove, in which the
<i>promuscis</i> when unemployed reposes.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous and remarkable appendages of
the manitrunk, are the <i>brachia</i> or arms. I shall not,
however, enter into the full consideration of these, as they
consist numerically of the same parts, till I treat of the
legs in general. Here it will only be necessary to assign
my reasons for calling them by a distinct denomination.
In this I think I am authorized, not only by the example
of LinnÃ©, who occasionally found it necessary to do this<a name="FNanchor_1636_1636" id="FNanchor_1636_1636"></a><a href="#Footnote_1636_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a>,
and more particularly by the ancient notion that this
pair of organs in insects were not to be reckoned as <i>legs</i><a name="FNanchor_1637_1637" id="FNanchor_1637_1637"></a><a href="#Footnote_1637_1637" class="fnanchor">[1637]</a>,
but likewise from their different position and functions.
They are so inserted in the <i>antepectus</i> as to point towards
the <i>head</i>, whereas the other two pair point to the <i>anus</i>.
With regard to their <i>functions</i>, besides being <i>ambulatory</i>,
and supporting the manitrunk in walking, they are
applied to many other purposes independent of that office,&mdash;thus
they are eminently the <i>scansory</i> or climbing
legs in almost all insects; in most <i>Carabi</i> L., by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
of the notch and calcar<a name="FNanchor_1638_1638" id="FNanchor_1638_1638"></a><a href="#Footnote_1638_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a>, they are <i>prehensory</i> legs; in
<i>Scarites</i> belonging to that tribe, the Lamellicorn beetles,
and the mole-cricket, they are <i>fossorious</i> legs, or proper
for digging<a name="FNanchor_1639_1639" id="FNanchor_1639_1639"></a><a href="#Footnote_1639_1639" class="fnanchor">[1639]</a>; in <i>Mantis</i>, <i>Nepa</i>, and some <i>Diptera</i>, they
are <i>raptorious</i>, or fitted to seize and dispatch their prey<a name="FNanchor_1640_1640" id="FNanchor_1640_1640"></a><a href="#Footnote_1640_1640" class="fnanchor">[1640]</a>:
they are used also by many insects to clean their head,
eyes, and antennÃ¦, &amp;c. For many of these purposes
they cannot be fit without a structure different from that
of the other legs, which renders it a matter of as great
convenience in descriptions to speak of them and their
parts under different names from those of the legs, as it
is of the arms of man; on this account it is that I propose
to give to the fore-leg and its part the names by which
the analogous parts, or what are so esteemed, in the human
species are distinguished;&mdash;when spoken of in common
with the other legs, they may still be called the forelegs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>** <i>Alitruncus.</i> The alitrunk is the posterior segment
of the trunk, which below bears the four true legs, and
above the organs for flight or their representatives. In
treating of this part we may consider its <i>insertion</i> or <i>articulation</i>,
its <i>shape</i>, <i>composition</i>, <i>substance</i>, <i>motions</i>, and
<i>organs</i>.</p>

<p>i. With regard to its <i>insertion</i>, or articulation with the
manitrunk and abdomen, it may be observed that it is
attached to both by its whole circumference by means of
ligament; in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>, and Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i> being received by the posterior cavity of
the <i>prothorax</i>, the shield of which in these Orders, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
the last, almost covers and conceals it; but in the
remaining ones it is merely suspended to it. In the
former also, especially in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, it seems more
separate and distinct from the manitrunk than from
the abdomen, and more independent of its motions
than of those of the latter part: but in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i> its greatest separation is from the
abdomen in both respects. In many insects, as in the
Lamellicorn beetles, the mole-cricket, &amp;c., the <i>manitrunk</i>
terminates posteriorly, drawing a line from the
base of the <i>prothorax</i> to the <i>antepectus</i>, in an oblique
section; in other tribes, as in the <i>Cerambyx</i> L., the
Predaceous beetles, &amp;c., the section here is <i>often</i> vertical,
but in the <i>alitrunk</i> the anterior one is <i>always</i> vertical,
while the posterior, by which it articulates with the
abdomen, in the Orders with an ample thoracic shield, is
oblique, so that the <i>pectoral</i> portion is more ample than
the <i>dorsal</i>.</p>

<p>ii. As to its <i>composition</i>, the alitrunk is usually much
more complex than the manitrunk; for, besides the instruments
of motion, it consists of numerous pieces. It
may be regarded as formed of <i>two</i> greater segments, the
first bearing the elytra, or the primary wings, and the
intermediate legs; and the second, the secondary wings
and the hind legs.</p>

<p>1. <i>Collare</i><a name="FNanchor_1641_1641" id="FNanchor_1641_1641"></a><a href="#Footnote_1641_1641" class="fnanchor">[1641]</a>. The first segment of the alitrunk is the
middle piece of the whole trunk, and therefore, when
spoken of <i>per se</i>, may be called the <i>meditruncus</i>. It
consists primarily of an upper and lower part, which
in the table are denominated the <i>mesothorax</i> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
<i>medipectus</i>. The first piece in the former that requires
notice is the <i>collar</i>. I formerly regarded this piece,
which is peculiar to the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, and one
tribe of the <i>Neuroptera</i>, as the representative of the <i>prothorax</i>
in the other Orders, and this opinion seems at this
time very generally adopted, but subsequent observations
have caused me to entertain considerable doubts
of its correctness. Many other Entomologists have
thought it improper to distinguish these parts by the
same name<a name="FNanchor_1642_1642" id="FNanchor_1642_1642"></a><a href="#Footnote_1642_1642" class="fnanchor">[1642]</a>. Much, however, may be said on both
sides of this question, and I shall now lay before you the
principal arguments that may be adduced in defence of
each opinion, beginning with those that seem to prove
that the collar <i>is</i> the analogue of the <i>prothorax</i>. First,
then, the collar, like the <i>prothorax</i>, is placed precisely
over the <i>antepectus</i>, and being placed in the <i>same</i> situation,
on that account seems entitled to the <i>same</i> denomination;
especially as in some genera, for instance <i>Chlorion</i>
F., it assumes the very semblance and magnitude of a
thoracic shield, and is separated from the <i>mesothorax</i> by
a considerable incisure. Again, in some cases that have
fallen under my own observation, the collar is endued
with some degree of motion distinct from that of the
alitrunk, since in <i>Pompilus</i> and <i>Chrysis</i> the animal can
make the former slide over the latter in a small degree.
A third and last argument is, that no <i>prophragm</i> is
formed from the collar: insects that have a thoracic shield
are generally distinguished by having the anterior margin
of the <i>dorsolum</i> deflexed so as to form a <i>septum</i>, called in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
the table the <i>prophragm</i>, which enters the chest and separates
the cavity of the <i>mesothorax</i> from that of the <i>prothorax</i>;
now in <i>Hymenoptera</i> this septum is a process
of the piece behind the collar, and excludes it from
having any share in that cavity. These arguments at
first sight seem to prove satisfactorily the <i>identity</i> of the
collar and <i>prothorax</i>. But <i>audi alteram partem</i>, and I
think you will allow that the scale containing the claims
of the collar to be considered as a piece <i>sui generis</i>, dips
much the lowest. And, first, I must observe, that
though in <i>Hymenoptera</i> the collar seems to replace the
<i>prothorax</i> by its situation, yet it is in fact a part of the
alitrunk; for, if the <i>manitrunk</i> be separated from the latter,
the collar remains, in most cases, attached to it<a name="FNanchor_1643_1643" id="FNanchor_1643_1643"></a><a href="#Footnote_1643_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a>,
while the <i>antepectus</i> and arm, with the ligament that covers
its cavity above, the real representative of the prothorax,
are easily removed, and this in recent individuals: as a
further proof of this, I must request you will examine a
neuter <i>Mutilla</i>; you will see that in this the collar is
not separated from the alitrunk in any respect, but forms
one piece with it, while the <i>antepectus</i> is distinct and
capable of separate motion: further, the action of the
collar is upon the alitrunk, it being of essential importance
in flight, whereas the <i>prothorax</i> is of no other importance
than as a counterpoise to that part<a name="FNanchor_1644_1644" id="FNanchor_1644_1644"></a><a href="#Footnote_1644_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a>. A further
argument to prove the distinction of these parts may be
drawn from the case of <i>Xylocopa</i>, a kind of bee. In this
genus the collar forms a complete <i>annulus</i> or segment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
the body: now, if it really represented the prothorax,
the under side of the segment, as in those <i>Coleoptera</i> in
which no suture separates the upper from the lower part
of the manitrunk<a name="FNanchor_1645_1645" id="FNanchor_1645_1645"></a><a href="#Footnote_1645_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a>, should represent the <i>antepectus</i>, and
have the arms inserted in it; but in the case before
us there is a distinct <i>antepectus</i> bearing the arms received
by the socket formed by this annulus. But the most
powerful argument is the fact that some insects have
both the <i>prothorax</i> and <i>collar</i>, a circumstance that completely
does away every idea of their identity. If you
examine the common hornet (<i>Vespa Crabro</i>), or any
saw-fly (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.), you will find, as was before intimated,
that the real covering of the cavity of the manitrunk
is a ligamentous membrane, which properly represents
the <i>prothorax</i>. In another genus of the same
order (<i>Xiphydria</i> Latr.), the sides of the <i>antepectus</i> turn
upwards and nearly form a horny covering distinct from
the collar<a name="FNanchor_1646_1646" id="FNanchor_1646_1646"></a><a href="#Footnote_1646_1646" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a>, the ligamentous part being reduced to a
very narrow line, and in <i>F&#339;nus</i> the dorsal fissure is quite
filled up, so that in this the manitrunk is perfectly distinct,
and exhibits both <i>prothorax</i> and <i>antepectus</i> of the
usual substance. In <i>Nomada</i> likewise, <i>N. Goodeniana</i> K.
was the species I examined, there is a short minute <i>prothorax</i>
besides the collar. Next let us turn our attention
to the <i>Diptera</i>; if you examine the common crane-fly
(<i>Tipula oleracea</i>), you will find, first, a regular short
<i>prothorax</i>, to which the <i>antepectus</i>, with the arms, is attached;
and behind this also is a short collar embracing
the alitrunk anteriorly. The next insects that I shall
mention, as exhibiting both <i>prothorax</i> and collar, are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
<i>Libellulina</i>. These are generally admitted to have the
former of these parts<a name="FNanchor_1647_1647" id="FNanchor_1647_1647"></a><a href="#Footnote_1647_1647" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a>, but besides this they have also
the latter, which is the most ample and conspicuous
piece in the whole trunk<a name="FNanchor_1648_1648" id="FNanchor_1648_1648"></a><a href="#Footnote_1648_1648" class="fnanchor">[1648]</a>; intervening, as the collar
should do, between the <i>prothorax</i> and those parts of the
trunk to which the wings are attached. There is one
circumstance connected with the subject which should
not be overlooked. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, usually under
a lateral process of the posterior part of the collar, is a
spiracle or respiratory apparatus; in the <i>Diptera</i> there
is also one, though not covered by the part in question,
in the same situation; now this you will find precisely so
situated with respect to the second piece in the thorax
of <i>Tipula oleracea</i>, proving that this piece is the real representative
of the collar. Enough, I think, has been
said to satisfy you that I have not changed my sentiments
on this subject upon slight grounds. Probably
traces of the part in question might be detected in the
thoracic Orders in general, in connexion with some
vocal or respiratory organ<a name="FNanchor_1649_1649" id="FNanchor_1649_1649"></a><a href="#Footnote_1649_1649" class="fnanchor">[1649]</a>; but having had no opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
by an extended examination of living subjects, to
verify or disprove this suspicion, I shall merely mention
it, and conclude this head by observing, that the collar
varies most in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> order, and that its most
remarkable form is in <i>Vespa</i>, <i>Cimbex</i>, <i>Dorylus</i>, &amp;c., in
which it bends into an ample sinus that receives the
dorsolum<a name="FNanchor_1650_1650" id="FNanchor_1650_1650"></a><a href="#Footnote_1650_1650" class="fnanchor">[1650]</a>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Dorsolum</i><a name="FNanchor_1651_1651" id="FNanchor_1651_1651"></a><a href="#Footnote_1651_1651" class="fnanchor">[1651]</a>. Where there is no apparent collar,
the <i>dorsolum</i> (dorslet) is the <i>first</i> piece of the <i>mesothorax</i>,
and where there is one, the <i>second</i>; it bears the elytra
or other primary organs of flight. It varies in the different
Orders, particularly with respect to its exposure.
In Coleopterous insects it is most commonly, but not
invariably<a name="FNanchor_1652_1652" id="FNanchor_1652_1652"></a><a href="#Footnote_1652_1652" class="fnanchor">[1652]</a>, covered entirely by the shield of the <i>prothorax</i>,
the <i>scutellum</i> alone being visible; as it is also
in the <i>Orthoptera</i> (with the exception of <i>Mantis</i> and
<i>Phasma</i>, in the first of which it is partially, and in the
latter intirely exposed), and the Heteropterous, and
most of the Homopterous section of the <i>Hemiptera</i>.
The scutellum is likewise covered in <i>Gerris</i>, <i>Hydrometra</i>,
and <i>Velia</i>, and the whole of the back of the alitrunk
by a process of the <i>prothorax</i> in <i>Acrydium</i> F., <i>Centrotus</i>,
&amp;c. But in the remaining Orders, and the tribe
of <i>Tettigonia</i> in the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, the <i>dorsolum</i>
is not hidden by the thoracic shield. It is usually
less elevated than the <i>scutellum</i>; in <i>Necrophorus</i>, and
some other beetles, however, the latter is most depressed.
With regard to its <i>substance</i>, it is generally not so hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
and rigid as the <i>scutellum</i>, but in most <i>Coleoptera</i> harder
than in the other Orders in which it is covered; in
the <i>Hemiptera</i>, except in <i>Tettigonia</i>, it approaches to
membrane. As to shape and other circumstances, it
varies in the different Orders. In the beetle tribes it
has generally a sinus taken out of its anterior margin,
and it approaches more or less to a trapezium; in <i>Blatta</i>
it is transverse and somewhat arched; in <i>Gryllotalpa</i> it
is nearly square, and distinguished besides on each side
by a minute aperture, fitted with a tense membrane,
which perhaps covers a respiratory apparatus. In the
locusts it is more or less triangular, and in <i>Mantis</i> and
<i>Phasma</i> long and slender. In the <i>Hemiptera</i> the <i>dorsolum</i>
appears to consist of several pieces, variously circumstanced,
separated by sutures, corresponding with
which are as many ridges on the inside of the crust<a name="FNanchor_1653_1653" id="FNanchor_1653_1653"></a><a href="#Footnote_1653_1653" class="fnanchor">[1653]</a>.
In the <i>Libellulina</i> it is rhomboidal<a name="FNanchor_1654_1654" id="FNanchor_1654_1654"></a><a href="#Footnote_1654_1654" class="fnanchor">[1654]</a>; in <i>Panorpa</i> nearly
hexagonal; in the <i>Ephemerina</i> it is ample and oblong;
in <i>Sialis</i> and the <i>Trichoptera</i> this part is represented by
three subtriangular pieces, the <i>scutellum</i> constituting a
fourth, with the vertices of the triangles meeting in the
centre<a name="FNanchor_1655_1655" id="FNanchor_1655_1655"></a><a href="#Footnote_1655_1655" class="fnanchor">[1655]</a>; in the <i>Lepidoptera</i> the part in question is large,
and receives the <i>scutellum</i> into its posterior sinus<a name="FNanchor_1656_1656" id="FNanchor_1656_1656"></a><a href="#Footnote_1656_1656" class="fnanchor">[1656]</a>. The
<i>Hymenoptera</i> usually exhibit a very ample <i>dorsolum</i>,
mostly subtriangular with the vertex rounded or truncated,
and pointing in some (<i>Vespa</i> L.) to the head<a name="FNanchor_1657_1657" id="FNanchor_1657_1657"></a><a href="#Footnote_1657_1657" class="fnanchor">[1657]</a>,
and in others (<i>Apis</i>) to the anus; in the <i>Diptera</i>, except in
<i>Tipula</i>, the parts of the <i>mesothorax</i> are not separated by
any suture, but only indicated by impressed lines or channels;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
in the genus last mentioned, however, the <i>dorsolum</i>
is distinct, subrhomboidal, and received by an angular
sinus of the <i>scutellum</i>, which last, I think, is not the
part that has usually been regarded as entitled to that
denomination; for this opinion I shall soon assign my
reasons.</p>

<p>3. <i>Scutellum</i><a name="FNanchor_1658_1658" id="FNanchor_1658_1658"></a><a href="#Footnote_1658_1658" class="fnanchor">[1658]</a>. Some writers on the anatomy of insects,
looking, it should seem, only at the <i>Coleoptera</i> and
<i>Orthoptera</i>, have regarded the <i>dorsolum</i> and <i>scutellum</i> as
forming only one piece<a name="FNanchor_1659_1659" id="FNanchor_1659_1659"></a><a href="#Footnote_1659_1659" class="fnanchor">[1659]</a>, and others have affirmed that
the <i>Lepidoptera</i> and subsequent Orders have no <i>scutellum</i><a name="FNanchor_1660_1660" id="FNanchor_1660_1660"></a><a href="#Footnote_1660_1660" class="fnanchor">[1660]</a>.
But as we proceed in considering the <i>scutellum</i>
in all the Orders, we shall see that both these opinions
are founded on partial views of the subject, and that all
winged insects have a <i>scutellum</i>, more or less distinctly
marked out or separated from the <i>dorsolum</i>. In the <i>Coleoptera</i>
the <i>scutellum</i> is usually the <i>visible</i>, mostly triangular,
piece that intervenes between the elytra at their
base<a name="FNanchor_1661_1661" id="FNanchor_1661_1661"></a><a href="#Footnote_1661_1661" class="fnanchor">[1661]</a>, and which terminates the <i>dorsolum</i>. Some Lamellicorn
beetles, &amp;c. (<i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> MacLeay) are stated not
to have the part in question (<i>exscutellati</i>): but this is not
strictly correct, for in these cases the <i>scutellum</i> exists as the
point of the <i>dorsolum</i> covered by the <i>prothorax</i>, though
it does not intervene between the elytra: in others of
this tribe, as <i>Cetonia chinensis</i>, <i>bajula</i>, &amp;c., it separates
these organs at their base, though it is covered by the
posterior lobe of the <i>prothorax</i>: in <i>Meloe</i> F., the elytra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
of which are immoveable, there seems really to be no
<i>scutellum</i>. Generally speaking, as was lately observed,
but not always, it is distinguished from the <i>dorsolum</i> by
being more elevated: this is particularly conspicuous in
the genus <i>Elater</i>, in which it is a flat plate elevated
from the <i>dorsolum</i> by a pedicle; in <i>Sagra</i> the latter part
is horizontal, while the <i>scutellum</i> is vertical: and even in
cases where the distinction is not so striking, these parts
are separated either by a line, or some difference in their
sculpture and substance. In this Order this part varies
greatly, and often in the same tribe or genus, both
in size and shape; being sometimes very large<a name="FNanchor_1662_1662" id="FNanchor_1662_1662"></a><a href="#Footnote_1662_1662" class="fnanchor">[1662]</a>, and
sometimes very minute; sometimes very long, and sometimes
very short; sometimes nearly round, at others
square; now oval or ovate, heart-shaped, triangular,
acuminate, intire, bifid, &amp;c. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, though
less conspicuous, it still is present as a triangular elevation
of the middle of the posterior part of the dorsolum,
with the vertex either pointing towards the head, as in
<i>Blatta</i>, or towards the tail, as in <i>Locusta</i> Leach<a name="FNanchor_1663_1663" id="FNanchor_1663_1663"></a><a href="#Footnote_1663_1663" class="fnanchor">[1663]</a>. In
the Heteropterous section of the <i>Hemiptera</i> (which, in
columns of <i>Mandibulata</i> and <i>Haustellata</i>, appear to bear
the same reference to the <i>Coleoptera</i>, that the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
do to the <i>Diptera</i>, and the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>
to the <i>Orthoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1664_1664" id="FNanchor_1664_1664"></a><a href="#Footnote_1664_1664" class="fnanchor">[1664]</a>) the part we are considering is
mostly very large and conspicuous, quite distinct from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
<i>dorsolum</i>, and in some (<i>Tetyra</i> F.) covering the whole
abdomen, as well as the <i>Hemelytra</i> and the wings; it is
most commonly, as in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, obtriangular<a name="FNanchor_1665_1665" id="FNanchor_1665_1665"></a><a href="#Footnote_1665_1665" class="fnanchor">[1665]</a>, but
in the last-mentioned genus it often approaches to a pentagonal
shape. Though usually so striking a feature in
this tribe, in the aquatic bugs (<i>Gerris</i> &amp;c.) it is covered
by the <i>prothorax</i>. In some species of <i>Reduvius</i> F. (<i>R.
biguttatus</i>, <i>mutillarius</i>, <i>lugens</i>, &amp;c.) it is armed with one
or more dorsal or terminal spines. In the Homopterous
section, where the <i>dorsolum</i>, as in <i>Tettigonia</i> F., is not
covered by the <i>prothorax</i>, the <i>scutellum</i>, which is merely
a continuation of that part, bears some resemblance to a
St. Andrew's cross, and terminates in a fork<a name="FNanchor_1666_1666" id="FNanchor_1666_1666"></a><a href="#Footnote_1666_1666" class="fnanchor">[1666]</a>; in <i>Fulgora</i>,
in which it is partly covered, it is merely the triangular
point of the <i>dorsolum</i>: in the <i>CercopidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., whose
<i>dorsolum</i> is wholly covered, the triangular scutellum is
distinct from it; in <i>Centrotus</i>, <i>Darnis</i>, and <i>Membracis</i>, in
which the <i>prothorax</i> is producted, and covers the abdomen
more or less, the <i>scutellum</i> is a short transverse distinct
piece. In the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, from the difficulty of
abrading sufficiently the scales and hairs without injury,
it is difficult to obtain a correct idea of the part in question;
in the cabbage butterfly (<i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>) it appears
to be triangular: in the humming-bird hawk-moth
(<i>Macro-glossum Stellatarum</i>) it approaches to a
rhomboidal shape<a name="FNanchor_1667_1667" id="FNanchor_1667_1667"></a><a href="#Footnote_1667_1667" class="fnanchor">[1667]</a>; and in the eggar-moth (<i>Lasiocampa
Quercus</i>) it is completely rhomboidal. In the <i>Libellulina</i>,
in the <i>Neuroptera</i> Order, it seems to be represented
by the posterior point of the <i>dorsolum</i>, which terminates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
in something like a St. Andrew's cross<a name="FNanchor_1668_1668" id="FNanchor_1668_1668"></a><a href="#Footnote_1668_1668" class="fnanchor">[1668]</a>. In most of
the other tribes of this Order the <i>scutellum</i> is a triangular
piece, with the vertex to the head, received between
two pieces of the dorsolum; in <i>Psocus</i> it is nearly like
that of <i>Tettigonia</i> before described. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
the <i>scutellum</i> is separated from the <i>dorsolum</i>, which
it often embraces posteriorly, as the collar does in front,
by a suture; it varies occasionally in shape in the different
tribes, most commonly it is crescent-shaped, but in
many <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i> and others it is triangular<a name="FNanchor_1669_1669" id="FNanchor_1669_1669"></a><a href="#Footnote_1669_1669" class="fnanchor">[1669]</a>; in the
hive bee, &amp;c., it overhangs the succeeding piece of the
alitrunk; in <i>Melecta</i>, <i>Crocisa</i>, &amp;c., it is armed with a pair
of sharp teeth<a name="FNanchor_1670_1670" id="FNanchor_1670_1670"></a><a href="#Footnote_1670_1670" class="fnanchor">[1670]</a>; in others (<i>Oxybelus uniglumis</i>, &amp;c.) with
one or more spines, and in some with a pair of long
horns<a name="FNanchor_1671_1671" id="FNanchor_1671_1671"></a><a href="#Footnote_1671_1671" class="fnanchor">[1671]</a>. Before I describe this part in the <i>Diptera</i>, it
will be proper to assign my reasons for considering a
different piece as its representative, from what has usually
been regarded as such, and which at first sight seems
the analogue of what I admit to be the <i>scutellum</i> in the
<i>Hymenoptera</i>. The <i>dorsolum</i>, and its concomitant the
<i>scutellum</i>, belong to the first pair of the organs of flight,
which are planted usually under the sides of the former,
and in the case of <i>wings</i>, by their Anal Area, connected
either mediately or immediately with the latter. Now, if
you trace the sides of the piece that I have considered as
the part in question in <i>Hymenoptera</i>, you will find that
they lead you not to the base of the <i>lower</i> but to that of
the upper <i>wings</i><a name="FNanchor_1672_1672" id="FNanchor_1672_1672"></a><a href="#Footnote_1672_1672" class="fnanchor">[1672]</a>, and in the saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
you will see clearly that the Anal Area of these wings is
attached to a process of it, a proof that it belongs to the
<i>mesothorax</i>, or region of that pair. But in the <i>Diptera</i>,
the part that has been usually called the <i>scutellum</i> is not
at all connected, either by situation or as a point of attachment,
with the wing itself, but with the lower valve of
the <i>alula</i>, which is with reason thought to be the representative
of the secondary wing of the tetrapterous Orders.
You may see this even in the common crane-fly (<i>Tipula</i>),
in which there is a real <i>alula</i>, connected by means of a lateral
process, terminating in ligament, with this supposed
<i>scutellum</i>. If you examine further the same insect, you
will easily find what I regard as the true one in the bilobed
piece which receives the <i>dorsolum</i>, situated between
the wings, and to the sides of which they are attached.
In <i>Asilus</i>, <i>Tabanus</i>, &amp;c., this part is transverse,
and only distinguished on each side by an oblique impressed
line; in the <i>MuscidÃ¦</i> it is square, and marked by
a straight transverse one.</p>

<p>4. <i>FrÃ¦num</i><a name="FNanchor_1673_1673" id="FNanchor_1673_1673"></a><a href="#Footnote_1673_1673" class="fnanchor">[1673]</a>. This appendage to the <i>scutellum</i> and
<i>dorsolum</i> varies considerably in the different Orders, and
in many cases, as you will see, is a very important part,
being the process by which the former is mostly connected
with the elytra or upper wings. In the <i>Coleoptera</i>,
the elytra of which are nearly stationary in flight,
and therefore less require any counteraction to prevent
their dislocation, this part is commonly merely a process
or incrassation of the under margin of the scutellum,
which towards the base of the <i>dorsolum</i> is dilated to
form the socket for the elytra. Its use as a countercheck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
in this Order is best exemplified in the common water-beetle
(<i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>). This at the inner base
of the elytra has a membranous fringed <i>alula</i> resembling
those of <i>Diptera</i>; to the lower fold of this the extremity
of the <i>frÃ¦num</i> is attached, which forms a right angle with
the scutellum, and the upper fold is attached to the base
of the elytrum<a name="FNanchor_1674_1674" id="FNanchor_1674_1674"></a><a href="#Footnote_1674_1674" class="fnanchor">[1674]</a>. The object of this appendage is probably
to prevent the dislocation of these organs, which
seems to indicate that they are used more in flight than
those of other beetles. The <i>BlattÃ¦</i> also, in the next Order,
have a winglet attached to the anal area of the <i>tegmina</i>.
The <i>frÃ¦num</i>, as in the preceding Order, lies under
the margin of the <i>scutellum</i> and <i>dorsolum</i>, but which
here forms one uninterrupted transverse line; it is nearly
vertical, and is attached to the <i>alula</i>. The structure
is not very different in the other <i>Orthoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1675_1675" id="FNanchor_1675_1675"></a><a href="#Footnote_1675_1675" class="fnanchor">[1675]</a>, but the
<i>frÃ¦num</i> is surmounted or strengthened by one or two
ridges; in <i>Mantis</i> it runs from the scutellum in an angular
or zigzag direction&mdash;but in all it is attached immediately
to the <i>tegmen</i>. In the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>
it is represented by the narrow bead adjacent to the
scutellum on each side<a name="FNanchor_1676_1676" id="FNanchor_1676_1676"></a><a href="#Footnote_1676_1676" class="fnanchor">[1676]</a>, which dilates into a flat plate as
it approaches the <i>Hemelytrum</i>, with the Anal Area of which
it is connected. But the Homopterous section of the Order
in question furnishes examples of the most remarkable
structure of this countercheck, which proves that it is really,
what its name imports, a <i>bridle</i>. If you examine the
great lanthorn-fly (<i>Fulgora laternaria</i>), or any species of
<i>Tettigonia</i>, &amp;c., you will find adjacent to the scutellum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
or parallel with it, on each side a flat plate; and from the
angle of that part in the first case, and from one of its
processes in the last, you will further perceive a ridge or
nervure which runs along this plate, in one forming an
angle, and in the other being nearly straight, to the base
of the <i>tegmen</i>, where it becomes a marginal nervure to a
membrane that is attached to the posterior part of the
base of the Anal and Costal Areas; and that this marginal
nervure, like a <i>trachea</i>, consists of a spiral thread, or
rather of a number of cartilaginous rings connected by
elastic membrane<a name="FNanchor_1677_1677" id="FNanchor_1677_1677"></a><a href="#Footnote_1677_1677" class="fnanchor">[1677]</a>, and consequently is capable of considerable
tension and relaxation, as the <i>tegmen</i> rises and
falls in flight. In the <i>Lepidoptera</i> it appears to be a
short piece overhung by the scutellum, which as it approaches
the base of the wing is dilated. In the <i>Libellulina</i>,
to go to the <i>Neuroptera</i>, it has the same kind of
elastic nervure connected with the Anal Area of the wing
which I have just described in the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>;
another nervure, in <i>Ãshna</i> at least, appears to
diverge upwards from the scutellar angle to the Intermediate
Area<a name="FNanchor_1678_1678" id="FNanchor_1678_1678"></a><a href="#Footnote_1678_1678" class="fnanchor">[1678]</a>: a structure little different distinguishes the
rest of the <i>Neuroptera</i>, and even the <i>Trichoptera</i>. In the
<i>Hymenoptera</i> this part varies somewhat; in the majority
perhaps of the Order, as well as in the <i>Diptera</i>, it appears
to be merely the lateral termination of the scutellum
where it joins the wing; but in some tribes, as in
<i>Tenthredo</i> L. (especially <i>Perga</i> Leach), <i>Sirex</i> L., and
the <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i>, a ridge, and sometimes two, runs
from the scutellum to the wing; the upper one, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
there are two, as in <i>Perga</i>, being the stoutest, and connecting
with the <i>Costal</i> Area, and the lower one with the
<i>Anal</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>Pnystega</i><a name="FNanchor_1679_1679" id="FNanchor_1679_1679"></a><a href="#Footnote_1679_1679" class="fnanchor">[1679]</a>. We learn from M. Chabrier, that in
the common dragon-fly, a space, consisting of three
triangles, which immediately succeeds the <i>frÃ¦num</i>, affords
attachment to no muscles, but merely covers aÃ«rial
vesicles<a name="FNanchor_1680_1680" id="FNanchor_1680_1680"></a><a href="#Footnote_1680_1680" class="fnanchor">[1680]</a>. This is the part I have called the <i>pnystega</i><a name="FNanchor_1681_1681" id="FNanchor_1681_1681"></a><a href="#Footnote_1681_1681" class="fnanchor">[1681]</a>.
An analogous piece may be discovered in <i>Phasma</i> and
<i>Mantis</i> in a similar situation; but I cannot trace it in
<i>Locusta</i> Leach, or in the other Orders.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having considered the parts that constitute the <i>mesothorax</i>,
we will next say something upon those, as far as
they require notice, that compose the <i>medipectus</i> or mid-breast.
But first I must observe, in general of the <i>medipectus</i>
and <i>postpectus</i> taken together, or the whole underside
of the <i>alitrunk</i>, that though usually they are in
the same level with the <i>antepectus</i> or under side of the
<i>manitrunk</i>, yet in several instances, as the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>
MacLeay, the <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c. they are much more
elevated than that part; they are also usually longer,
very remarkably so in <i>Atractocerus</i>, but in <i>Elater sulcatus</i>
and many others they are shorter. These parts
are also commonly rather more elevated than the abdomen,&mdash;much
so in some, as <i>Molorchus</i>; but scarcely at all
in others, as <i>Buprestis</i>, the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, &amp;c.
In some of the latter (<i>Tetyra</i> F.) the abdomen seems
the most prominent. Another observation relating to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
this part must not be omitted, namely, that though in
many cases the <i>medipectus</i> and <i>postpectus</i> are perfectly
distinct and may be separated, yet in others, as for instance
the Lamellicorn beetles, the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and
<i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c., no suture separates them; so that though
the upper parts, the <i>mesothorax</i> and <i>metathorax</i>, are separable,
the lower ones just named are not so.</p>

<p>6. <i>Peristethium</i><a name="FNanchor_1682_1682" id="FNanchor_1682_1682"></a><a href="#Footnote_1682_1682" class="fnanchor">[1682]</a>. The first piece of the <i>medipectus</i> is
what I have called, after Knoch, the <i>peristethium</i><a name="FNanchor_1683_1683" id="FNanchor_1683_1683"></a><a href="#Footnote_1683_1683" class="fnanchor">[1683]</a>. This
immediately follows the <i>antepectus</i>; on each side it is
limited by the scapulars, and behind by the mid-legs and
<i>mesosternum</i>. Its antagonist above is usually the <i>dorsolum</i>.
In the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order it varies occasionally,
both in form and magnitude, but not so as to merit particular
notice, except that both are regulated by the scapulars&mdash;if
these are small, the <i>peristethium</i> is ample; and,
<i>vice versa</i>, if they are large it is small. In all the following
Orders, except the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, it is equally
inconspicuous, but in them it is often more remarkable.
I have a Brazilian species of <i>Cimbex</i> (<i>C. mammifera</i>
K. MS.) which appears undescribed, in which this part
swells into two breast-like protuberances, terminating
posteriorly in membrane, as if it had separate motion: in
the golden-wasps (<i>Chrysis</i> L.) it is anteriorly concave to
receive the <i>coxÃ¦</i> of the mid-legs; and in <i>Stilbum</i>, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
same tribe, it is armed with one or more conical obtuse
teeth.</p>

<p>7. <i>Scapularia</i><a name="FNanchor_1684_1684" id="FNanchor_1684_1684"></a><a href="#Footnote_1684_1684" class="fnanchor">[1684]</a>. The scapulars are situated between the
<i>coxÃ¦</i> of the mid-legs and the base or axis of the upper
organs of flight, and they seem to act as a fulcrum to each.
In the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order they are most commonly quadrangular
or subquadrangular, often divided diagonally,
and sometimes transversely, by an impressed line; the
posterior part, which is usually the most elevated and
often has an uneven angular surface, is that which intervenes
between the coxÃ¦ and elytra: where the former
are short, as in the Capricorn beetles, the scapulars are
long; and where they are long, as in the Petalocerous
ones, the latter are short. The anterior part is that
which forms the lateral limit of the <i>peristethium</i>, upon
which it often encroaches: this part, in conjunction with
the <i>dorsolum</i> above, and the last-named part below,
forms the kind of <i>rotula</i> that plays in the posterior <i>acetabulum</i>
of the manitrunk, as the head does in the anterior
one. In the flower-chafers (<i>Cetonia</i> F.) the scapulars
are very thick and elevated, and interpose between the
posterior angles of the <i>prothorax</i> and the shoulders of
the <i>elytra</i>, which is one of the distinguishing characters
of that tribe: in this case the lower angle of the scapular
connects with the <i>coxa</i> of the mid-leg, and the upper
angle with the axis of the <i>elytra</i>; and the most elevated
and thickest part of the scapular is about midway between
the two. This robust structure seems to indicate that
the scapular has to counteract a powerful action both of
the leg and elytrum. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> the scapulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
are usually divided into two parallel pieces, corresponding
probably, though more distinct, with the two parts lately
noticed of those of the <i>Coleoptera</i>: the upper side of
the socket of the mid-leg is common to the base of <i>both</i>
these pieces, but the articulation of the <i>tegmen</i> is chiefly
with the <i>anterior</i> one. In the grasshoppers, locusts, &amp;c.
(<i>Gryllus</i> L.) in which tribe this leg is nearly <i>opposite</i> to
that part, the scapular inclines but little from a vertical
position<a name="FNanchor_1685_1685" id="FNanchor_1685_1685"></a><a href="#Footnote_1685_1685" class="fnanchor">[1685]</a>; but in the praying-insects (<i>Mantis</i>), spectres
(<i>Phasma</i>), and cockroaches (<i>Blatta</i>), in which the insertion
of the mid-legs is <i>behind</i> that of the <i>tegmina</i>, it is
nearly horizontal. In the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i> the
anterior part of the scapular is covered by the <i>antepectus</i>,
and separated by a ridge, more or less pronounced, from
the open part; the whole is of an irregular shape, and
nearly parallel with the <i>parapleura</i>. In the Homopterous
section it likewise consists of two pieces, and sometimes
of more. Thus in <i>Tettigonia</i> F. it is bilobed, and between
it and the coxa two small pieces are inserted<a name="FNanchor_1686_1686" id="FNanchor_1686_1686"></a><a href="#Footnote_1686_1686" class="fnanchor">[1686]</a>. In
some others, <i>Iassus Lanio</i> F., &amp;c., it is not very unlike
the scapular in <i>Coleoptera</i>, being subquadrangular and
divided diagonally. In the <i>Neuroptera</i> this part and the
<i>parapleura</i> are parallel, and placed obliquely<a name="FNanchor_1687_1687" id="FNanchor_1687_1687"></a><a href="#Footnote_1687_1687" class="fnanchor">[1687]</a>. In the
common dragon-fly (<i>Ãshna viatica</i>) the former forms
nearly a parallelogram<a name="FNanchor_1688_1688" id="FNanchor_1688_1688"></a><a href="#Footnote_1688_1688" class="fnanchor">[1688]</a>, which is not divided by any
ridge or channel, but its lower half is separated into two
unequal parts by a black longitudinal line, opposed to
which on the inside is a ridge. The mid-leg in these is
connected with the scapular by the intervention of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
triangular transverse anterior piece, which in fact seems
only marked by a black channel, to which also interiorly
a ridge is opposed<a name="FNanchor_1689_1689" id="FNanchor_1689_1689"></a><a href="#Footnote_1689_1689" class="fnanchor">[1689]</a>. In the rest of the Order it is divided
longitudinally into <i>two</i> parallel pieces. In <i>Panorpa</i> the
posterior piece is longer than the anterior and props
the coxa behind; in <i>Myrmeleon</i> and <i>Perla</i>, &amp;c., it appears
to consist of <i>three</i> pieces. I have not been able to
obtain a clear idea of them in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, except
that they have more than one piece. <i>Hymenopterous</i>
and <i>Dipterous</i> insects for the most part have no scapular
distinct from the <i>peristethium</i>; but in <i>Cimbex</i>, <i>Perga</i>,
and other saw-flies, it seems represented by its posterior
depressed and sometimes membranous part: in <i>Vespa</i>,
&amp;c. a small subtriangular piece, just below the base of
the upper wing, is probably its analogue<a name="FNanchor_1690_1690" id="FNanchor_1690_1690"></a><a href="#Footnote_1690_1690" class="fnanchor">[1690]</a>.</p>

<p>8. <i>Mesosternum</i><a name="FNanchor_1691_1691" id="FNanchor_1691_1691"></a><a href="#Footnote_1691_1691" class="fnanchor">[1691]</a>. The central part of the <i>medipectus</i>,
or that which passes between the mid-legs when elevated,
protended, or otherwise remarkable, is called the
<i>mesosternum</i> or mid-breast-bone. In the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order
it exhibits the most numerous variations, and is
usually the most strongly marked of any of the three
portions of the <i>sternum</i>, affording often important characters
for the discrimination of genera and subgenera.
It may be said to be formed upon three principal types&mdash;the
first is, where it is a process of the posterior part of
the <i>peristethium</i>, and points towards the anus or the
head;&mdash;the second, where it is a process of the anterior
part of the <i>mesostethium</i>, and points only towards the
head: in this case there is no suture to separate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
<i>medipectus</i> from the <i>postpectus</i>;&mdash;the last type is where
it is a ridge formed by a process both of the <i>peristethium</i>
and <i>mesostethium</i> meeting between the legs; an example
of this you will see in the common dung-chafer (<i>Geotrupes</i>
Latr.). Upon the two first of these cases I shall
offer a few remarks;&mdash;the last affording no variation
need only be mentioned.</p>

<p>If you examine the terrestrial Predaceous beetles
(<i>Cicindela</i> and <i>Carabus</i> L.) you will find that the <i>peristethium</i>
is usually flat, terminating towards the <i>postpectus</i>
in a kind of fork, the sinus of which receives the anterior
point of the <i>mesostethium</i>&mdash;this is the <i>mesosternum</i>; but
in the aquatic insects of this tribe, at least in <i>Dytiscus
marginalis</i>, &amp;c. the structure at first sight seems different,
for <i>apparently</i> the <i>prosternum</i> is received by the
anterior fork of the <i>mesostethium</i>; but if you proceed to
separate the manitrunk from the alitrunk, you will find
that the true <i>mesosternum</i> of the usual form is quite
covered by this point, which curves towards the breast,
is longitudinally concave to receive the point of the <i>prosternum</i>,
and permit its motion in the groove. In some
Heteromerous beetles, as the <i>HelopidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c. this part is
anteriorly bilobed, so as to form a cavity which receives
the point of the <i>prosternum</i> when the head is bent down:
in <i>Helops nitens</i> (<i>Tenebrio</i> Oliv.) this sinus represents a
crescent; in <i>Cistela Ceramboides</i> it is shaped like the
Greek letter &#947;; in the Lady-bird (<i>Coccinella</i> L.) it assumes
nearly the shape of a Saint Andrew's cross; in
<i>Spheniscus</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_1692_1692" id="FNanchor_1692_1692"></a><a href="#Footnote_1692_1692" class="fnanchor">[1692]</a> the <i>mesosternum</i> is wide, concave and
wrinkled, with an anterior and posterior sinus; while in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
the analogous genus <i>Erotylus</i><a name="FNanchor_1693_1693" id="FNanchor_1693_1693"></a><a href="#Footnote_1693_1693" class="fnanchor">[1693]</a> it is convex anteriorly,
and posteriorly more or less rounded; in <i>Doryphora</i> it
is a long, robust, subconical horn, often standing at an
angle of about 45Â°, overhanging the <i>prosternum</i>.</p>

<p>In the genus last named, though its <i>mesosternum</i> in its
direction and appearance resembles that of many Petalocerous
beetles, yet it is separated by an evident suture
from the <i>mesostethium</i>; but in the last-mentioned tribe
its representative is a process of the latter part: yet as
the <i>peristethium</i> and <i>mesostethium</i> are separated by no
suture, though in some cases a transverse channel, and
in others merely a coloured line, marks the point where
they may be considered as soldered together, in these
cases the <i>mesosternum</i> may perhaps be said to be
common to both. In this great family, which includes
within its limits some of the most singular and wonderful
in their structure and armour, as well as some of the
most brilliant and beautiful of the beetle tribes,&mdash;the part
in question, in a vast number of cases, will enable the
Entomologist satisfactorily to trace its numerous groups,
not only where it rises or stretches out into a horn or
ridge, but even often where it is merely a flat space between
the mid-legs. I shall notice some of its most
striking variations in this tribe. In <i>PhanÃ¦us festivus</i>,
and in <i>Macraspis</i> and <i>Chasmodia</i> MacLeay, it is elongated
horizontally, with the apex curving upwards; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
<i>Anoplognathus</i> it is horizontal, straight, and figures an
isosceles triangle; in <i>Cetonia suturalis</i>, <i>vitticollis</i>, &amp;c.
it is very long, passing between the arms and nearly
reaching the head; in <i>C. marmorea</i>, <i>Lanius</i>, &amp;c. it is a
lofty, robust, conical prominence; and in many <i>RutelidÃ¦</i>,
especially those with striated elytra, it is pyramidal
or four-sided; it varies also in its <i>termination</i>, particularly
in the <i>CetoniadÃ¦</i>; and even where there is little or
no elevation of it, as in the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> MacLeay, it is
often terminated anteriorly by lines that vary in their
angle or curvature. The genus <i>Copris</i>, as restricted by
Mr. W. S. MacLeay, may from an inspection of this
circumstance be divided into several families. Thus in
<i>C. Molossus</i> and affinities its <i>termination</i> represents the
letter &#8516; reversed, or a triangle surmounted by a mucro;
in <i>C. orientalis</i>, &amp;c., it ends in an acute-angled triangle;
in <i>C. lunaris</i>, &amp;c. in an obtuse-angled one; and in
<i>C. Iacchus</i>, &amp;c., in the segment of a circle.</p>

<p>The part we are considering is not so important in
the other Orders. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, however, it is occasionally
remarkable. In <i>Acrida viridissima</i> (<i>Locusta</i> F.)
attached to the anterior margin of the <i>peristethium</i> are
two long triangular pieces which appear to represent this
part; in the kindred subgenus, <i>Conocephalus</i><a name="FNanchor_1694_1694" id="FNanchor_1694_1694"></a><a href="#Footnote_1694_1694" class="fnanchor">[1694]</a>, it is a
single piece bifid at the apex; in <i>Gryllotalpa</i> it is a very
elevated hairy ridge; and in <i>Locusta</i> Leach, it is a flat
anterior process of the <i>mesostethium</i>. In the Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i> this part is often merely a portion of
the channel in which the <i>promuscis</i> reposes; but sometimes,
as in <i>Edessa</i> F., it is an elevated piece varying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
in its termination. In the remaining Orders, as far as I
have had an opportunity to examine them, it can
scarcely be said to exist separately from the <i>medipectus</i>,
except that in <i>Tipula</i> Latr. a bipartite subtriangular
membranous piece seems to be its analogue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are now to consider the last segment of the alitrunk,
which, as a whole, may be denominated the <i>potruncus</i>;
it bears the second pair of the organs of flight,
and the last pair of legs. The upper side of this is the
<i>metathorax</i>, and its lower side the <i>postpectus</i>.</p>

<p>9. <i>Postdorsolum</i><a name="FNanchor_1695_1695" id="FNanchor_1695_1695"></a><a href="#Footnote_1695_1695" class="fnanchor">[1695]</a>. The first external piece of the
<i>metathorax</i> is the <i>postdorsolum</i>, which presents itself
under very different forms and circumstances in the different
Orders. In the <i>Coleoptera</i> it is intirely covered
by the <i>dorsolum</i> and <i>scutellum</i>; it is generally more or less
of a membranous substance, or partly membranous and
partly corneous, which enables it to yield more to the
action of the wings in flight; it is usually an ample
transverse piece with tumid sides<a name="FNanchor_1696_1696" id="FNanchor_1696_1696"></a><a href="#Footnote_1696_1696" class="fnanchor">[1696]</a>; but in the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>
MacLeay, it is short though very wide; and in <i>Cychrus</i>,
and probably other <i>apterous</i> beetles, it is extremely minute
and almost obsolete. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> Order, I
observe once for all, the part in question, as well as
the <i>postscutellum</i> and <i>postfrÃ¦num</i> are mere counterparts
of the <i>dorsolum</i>, <i>scutellum</i>, and <i>frÃ¦num</i>, except that in
some cases they are larger<a name="FNanchor_1697_1697" id="FNanchor_1697_1697"></a><a href="#Footnote_1697_1697" class="fnanchor">[1697]</a>. In the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>
at first sight it would appear that all the parts of
the <i>metathorax</i> were altogether wanting or absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
in the ample <i>scutellum</i>; but if you remove this with care,
you will find <i>under</i> it their representatives, its lower surface
being hollowed out to receive them. The <i>postdorsolum</i>
appears in these as a transverse obtusangular band;
in the <i>NepidÃ¦</i>, <i>NotonectidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c. the three parts of the
<i>metathorax</i> seem united into a single plate, emerging
laterally from under the <i>scutellum</i> below the <i>frÃ¦num</i>; in
which, however, some traces of a distinction between
them may be discovered. In the Homopterous section
the <i>FulgoridÃ¦</i> exhibit these pieces very distinctly, covered
only at the base by the <i>mesothorax</i>: but in <i>Tettigonia</i>
they are not so easily detected; they exist however as a
narrow strip or band, almost concealed by that part.
As to the <i>Lepidoptera</i> Order, in <i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i> at least,
the <i>postdorsolum</i> is represented by a pair of nearly equilateral
triangles whose vertexes meet in the centre of the
<i>metathorax</i>, and between which and the <i>scutellum</i> is a
deep cavity; but in <i>Macroglossum Stellatarum</i> and <i>Lasiocampa
Quercus</i>, there appears to be also a central
transverse piece between them. In the <i>Neuroptera</i> there
is no material or striking difference between the parts of
the <i>mesothorax</i> and <i>metathorax</i><a name="FNanchor_1698_1698" id="FNanchor_1698_1698"></a><a href="#Footnote_1698_1698" class="fnanchor">[1698]</a>. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
more variety occurs in this part. In the saw-flies, &amp;c.
(<i>Tenthredo</i> L.) the <i>postdorsolum</i> is a transverse piece
covered by the <i>scutellum</i>; in the <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i> it is
smaller, but not covered; in the <i>VespidÃ¦</i> it is apparent,
transverse, and with the <i>postscutellum</i> obtusangular<a name="FNanchor_1699_1699" id="FNanchor_1699_1699"></a><a href="#Footnote_1699_1699" class="fnanchor">[1699]</a>; in
<i>Apis</i> it is overhung by the <i>scutellum</i>. The <i>Diptera</i> exhibit
some variations in this part. In <i>Tipula</i> it consists of
three pieces placed transversely, the central one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
quadrangular, and the lateral ones roundish; in the <i>AsilidÃ¦</i>
and most others of this Order, with the <i>postscutellum</i>, it
forms a segment of a circle<a name="FNanchor_1700_1700" id="FNanchor_1700_1700"></a><a href="#Footnote_1700_1700" class="fnanchor">[1700]</a>, sometimes armed with a
pair of spines, as in <i>Stratyomis</i> F., and is what has been
usually regarded as the real <i>scutellum</i>, though, as I have
endeavoured to show, not correctly<a name="FNanchor_1701_1701" id="FNanchor_1701_1701"></a><a href="#Footnote_1701_1701" class="fnanchor">[1701]</a>.</p>

<p>10. <i>Postscutellum</i><a name="FNanchor_1702_1702" id="FNanchor_1702_1702"></a><a href="#Footnote_1702_1702" class="fnanchor">[1702]</a>. The <i>postscutellum</i> bears the same
relation to the <i>postdorsolum</i> that the <i>scutellum</i> does to the
<i>dorsolum</i>, but it is seldom, if ever, a distinct piece. In the
<i>Coleoptera</i> it is represented by the longitudinal narrow
channel that terminates the <i>postdorsolum</i> towards the
anus<a name="FNanchor_1703_1703" id="FNanchor_1703_1703"></a><a href="#Footnote_1703_1703" class="fnanchor">[1703]</a>: this usually figures an isosceles triangle with the
vertex truncated or open; but in <i>Copris</i> the triangle is
equilateral. In the other Orders it is little more than
the central posterior point of the <i>postdorsolum</i><a name="FNanchor_1704_1704" id="FNanchor_1704_1704"></a><a href="#Footnote_1704_1704" class="fnanchor">[1704]</a>.</p>

<p>11. <i>PostfrÃ¦num</i><a name="FNanchor_1705_1705" id="FNanchor_1705_1705"></a><a href="#Footnote_1705_1705" class="fnanchor">[1705]</a>. The part now mentioned is much
more important than the preceding one, and must not be
passed over so cursorily. In the <i>Coleoptera</i> it usually
presents itself under the form of two large and usually
rather square panels, the disk of which is convex, but
the rest of their surface unequal, which are situated one
on each side of the postscutellum<a name="FNanchor_1706_1706" id="FNanchor_1706_1706"></a><a href="#Footnote_1706_1706" class="fnanchor">[1706]</a>; under the anterior
outer angle of these is the socket or principal attachment
of the secondary wings, and their basal margin is attached
to their outer side; posteriorly behind the vertex
of the <i>postscutellum</i> the <i>postfrÃ¦num</i> is crowned with a
ridge or bead, below which it descends vertically or
obliquely to the abdomen; this ridge often turns upwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
and proceeds towards the middle of the basal margin of
the wing. In the Petalocerous beetles the part in question
is usually more or less hairy; but in many others,
as the rose-scented Capricorn (<i>Callichroma moschatum</i>),
&amp;c. it is naked. At its side you will commonly observe
several plates and tendons (<i>osselets</i> Chabr.) connected
<i>inter se</i> and with the base of the wing by elastic ligaments,
which are calculated to facilitate the play of those
organs. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>, and Homopterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, the <i>postfrÃ¦num</i> does not differ materially
from the <i>frÃ¦num</i><a name="FNanchor_1707_1707" id="FNanchor_1707_1707"></a><a href="#Footnote_1707_1707" class="fnanchor">[1707]</a>. In the Heteropterous section
of the last Order it is usually a transverse ridge terminating
the <i>postdorsolum</i>, with a bifurcation where it
unites with the wing; but in <i>Tetyra</i> F. (at least so it is
in <i>Tetyra signata</i>,) it is a nearly vertical piece, marked in
the centre with an infinity of very minute folds, which
probably by their alternate tension and relaxation let
out and pull in the wings. Amongst the <i>Lepidoptera</i> it
is not remarkable. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> Order it is
mostly represented, I think, by a double ridge or fork,
sometimes however obsolete, but very conspicuous in the
saw-flies, which laterally terminates the <i>postdorsolum</i>;
the upper branch, usually the thickest, going to the anterior
part of the base of the underwing, and the lower
one to the posterior. You may observe something similar
in the crane-flies (<i>Tipula</i> Latr.) and <i>AsilidÃ¦</i>. A
tendon proceeding from the point of the <i>postscutellum</i>
forms a fork near its end, the upper branch of which
connects with the anterior and the lower with the posterior
valve of the winglet; the structure is a little, but not
essentially, different in other <i>Diptera</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p>12. <i>Pleura</i><a name="FNanchor_1708_1708" id="FNanchor_1708_1708"></a><a href="#Footnote_1708_1708" class="fnanchor">[1708]</a>. By this name I would distinguish the
part which laterally connects the <i>metathorax</i> and <i>postpectus</i>.
It includes in it the socket of the secondary
wings. In the <i>Coleoptera</i> this is a two-sided piece lying
between the <i>postfrÃ¦num</i> and the <i>parapleura</i>, with the
upper side horizontal and the lower vertical<a name="FNanchor_1709_1709" id="FNanchor_1709_1709"></a><a href="#Footnote_1709_1709" class="fnanchor">[1709]</a>&mdash;a tendon
usually proceeds from its anterior extremity to the base of
the wing. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>, and other Orders,
it is merely the longitudinal line of attachment of that
part; but in the genus <i>Belostoma</i> Latreille, related to the
water-scorpion, it presents a peculiar structure, being a
deep channel or demitube, filled at its posterior extremity
by a spiracle and its appendages<a name="FNanchor_1710_1710" id="FNanchor_1710_1710"></a><a href="#Footnote_1710_1710" class="fnanchor">[1710]</a>.</p>

<p>13. <i>Metapnystega</i><a name="FNanchor_1711_1711" id="FNanchor_1711_1711"></a><a href="#Footnote_1711_1711" class="fnanchor">[1711]</a>. This part, although in the table I
have placed it as an appendage of the <i>pleurÃ¦</i>, is not always
confined to them, as you will soon see. It either covers
aÃ«rial vesicles, or is the seat of a spiracle. In the Order
<i>Coleoptera</i> it is of the former description. If you examine
the <i>metathorax</i> of the common dung-chafer (<i>Geotrupes
stercorarius</i>), in the horizontal part of the <i>pleura</i>
you will see a sublanceolate or subelliptical rather membranous
silky tense plate, with its point towards the head,&mdash;this
is the part we are considering; something similar
you will find in most beetles; but in some, as <i>Callichroma
moschatum</i>, it is less conspicuous. This part, as far as I
have observed, is not so situated in any other Order, except
in some Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>: in <i>Belostoma</i> the
channel lately mentioned is filled up at its posterior end
by a red organ with an anterior vertical fissure, terminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
behind in a conical bag: in <i>Notonecta</i> the <i>pleura</i>
has something of a plate like that of <i>Coleoptera</i>, but of
a horny substance. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Neuroptera</i>
this part changes its situation, if it be indeed synonymous;
and as the <i>pnystega</i> follows the <i>frÃ¦num</i>, so the
<i>metapnystega</i> succeeds the <i>postfrÃ¦num</i>. In the <i>Libellulina</i>
M. Chabrier found that this as well as the other covered
aÃ«rial vesicles<a name="FNanchor_1712_1712" id="FNanchor_1712_1712"></a><a href="#Footnote_1712_1712" class="fnanchor">[1712]</a>, and it probably does the same in the
other cases in which it occurs. In <i>Mantis</i> and <i>Phasma</i>
in the <i>Orthoptera</i> it is very minute; but in <i>Locusta</i>
Leach, it is more conspicuous under the form of a tense
membrane, the surface of which is depressed below that
of the abdomen: in <i>Acrida viridissima</i> K. it fills the
sinus of the <i>postfrÃ¦num</i>, and is vertical, as it is in
<i>Ãshna</i>. It is worthy of remark that this piece bears
some analogy to that below the ridge of the part just
named in <i>Coleoptera</i>, which descends either vertically
or obliquely to the abdomen<a name="FNanchor_1713_1713" id="FNanchor_1713_1713"></a><a href="#Footnote_1713_1713" class="fnanchor">[1713]</a>. A similar space,
though often nearly obsolete, may be seen in the <i>Hemiptera</i>
and <i>Lepidoptera</i>. But the Orders in which this
part is most conspicuous are the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>,
and in these its aÃ«rial vessels are connected with a
spiracle. In <i>Tenthredo</i> L. and <i>Sirex</i> L., what LinnÃ©
named <i>grana</i>, from their situation, should be regarded as
belonging to the <i>pnystega</i>, and whether there is any part
representing the <i>metapnystega</i> I am not quite satisfied;
perhaps the membrane at the base of the abdomen in
<i>Tenthredo</i>, and the bipartite piece, apparently its first
segment, in <i>Sirex</i><a name="FNanchor_1714_1714" id="FNanchor_1714_1714"></a><a href="#Footnote_1714_1714" class="fnanchor">[1714]</a>, may be its analogues: but in the great
majority of the Order, the convex or flat piece that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
intervenes between the <i>postdorsolum</i> and its adjuncts and
the abdomen, and which bears a spiracle on each side,
is the <i>metapnystega</i><a name="FNanchor_1715_1715" id="FNanchor_1715_1715"></a><a href="#Footnote_1715_1715" class="fnanchor">[1715]</a>. This part is often remarkable,
not only for its size, but for the elevated ridges that
traverse it, as in <i>Ichneumon</i>, <i>Chlorion</i>, &amp;c. In the last
genus it is of a pyramidal shape, with the anterior part
horizontal and the posterior vertical; it is altogether
vertical in <i>Vespa</i>, <i>Apis</i>, &amp;c. Amongst the <i>Diptera</i>, in <i>Tipula</i>
it is nearly horizontal, and shaped like a cushion;
but in general in this Order it is vertical, and concealed
under the <i>postdorsolum</i><a name="FNanchor_1716_1716" id="FNanchor_1716_1716"></a><a href="#Footnote_1716_1716" class="fnanchor">[1716]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are now to consider the parts that constitute the
<i>postpectus</i> or under-side of the <i>metathorax</i>, and which
bears the posterior pair of legs.</p>

<p>14. <i>Mesostethium</i><a name="FNanchor_1717_1717" id="FNanchor_1717_1717"></a><a href="#Footnote_1717_1717" class="fnanchor">[1717]</a>. This part in <i>Coleoptera</i> is terminated
anteriorly by the <i>peristethium</i>, <i>scapulars</i>, and <i>mesosternum</i>,
laterally by the <i>parapleurÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1718_1718" id="FNanchor_1718_1718"></a><a href="#Footnote_1718_1718" class="fnanchor">[1718]</a>, and behind by
the coxÃ¦ of the posterior legs<a name="FNanchor_1719_1719" id="FNanchor_1719_1719"></a><a href="#Footnote_1719_1719" class="fnanchor">[1719]</a>, which generally are inserted
transversely between it and the abdomen. It is
commonly very wide; but in <i>Dytiscus</i> L., <i>Carabus</i> L.,
&amp;c., in which the <i>coxÃ¦</i> and <i>parapleurÃ¦</i> are dilated, it is
proportionally reduced: its length is regulated by the
distance of the intermediate and posterior legs; where
these are far asunder, as in the rose-scented Capricorn
(<i>Callichroma moschatum</i>), &amp;c. it is long: but where they
are near each other, as in the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> MacLeay, it
is short; its width, however, generally exceeds its length.
In shape it is generally subquadrangular<a name="FNanchor_1720_1720" id="FNanchor_1720_1720"></a><a href="#Footnote_1720_1720" class="fnanchor">[1720]</a>, though sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
rhomboidal, and other forms of it occur. Between
the hind-legs it generally terminates in a notch or bifurcation
distinct from the <i>metasternum</i>, as in <i>Hydrophilus</i>,
&amp;c.; in <i>Hister</i> there is no notch, and in many <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i>
it projects between the hind-legs in a truncated
or rounded mucro; in the Vesicatory beetles, <i>Meloe</i>
L., it is more elevated than the <i>medipectus</i>, towards
which it descends almost vertically; in <i>Dytiscus</i> L., <i>Carabus</i>
L., &amp;c., this part is usually divided into two by a
<i>transverse</i> sinuous channel, and in <i>Elater</i> by a <i>longitudinal</i>
straight one. In many <i>Orthopterous</i> genera, <i>Gryllotalpa</i>,
<i>Acrida</i> K., <i>Locusta</i> Leach, &amp;c., the <i>mesostethium</i>
consists of <i>two</i> pieces<a name="FNanchor_1721_1721" id="FNanchor_1721_1721"></a><a href="#Footnote_1721_1721" class="fnanchor">[1721]</a>. It is remarkable that in many of
these genera, in this part, as likewise in the <i>medipectus</i> and
<i>antepectus</i>, are one or more perforations which appear to
enter the chest, the use of which I shall explain hereafter.
In the <i>Libellulina</i>, as I shall soon have occasion to shew,
there is a peculiar arrangement of the legs and wings, in
consequence of which this part is placed behind the posterior
ones. In the remaining Orders, the <i>mesostethium</i>,
though it exists, exhibits no peculiarities worthy of particular
notice, except in some <i>Aptera</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>:
thus, in <i>Nirmus Anseris</i> it is terminated posteriorly by
a pair of transverse membranous appendages which
cover the base of the posterior <i>coxÃ¦</i>; in <i>Scorpio</i> it consists
of two pieces, the <i>pectines</i><a name="FNanchor_1722_1722" id="FNanchor_1722_1722"></a><a href="#Footnote_1722_1722" class="fnanchor">[1722]</a> being attached to the
sides of the posterior one.</p>

<p>15. <i>Parapleura</i><a name="FNanchor_1723_1723" id="FNanchor_1723_1723"></a><a href="#Footnote_1723_1723" class="fnanchor">[1723]</a>. The <i>parapleura</i>, speaking generally,
is that piece of the <i>postpectus</i> which, intervening
between the <i>pleura</i>, <i>mesostethium</i>, and <i>scapulars</i>, is attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
by its posterior extremity to the <i>coxÃ¦</i> of the hind-legs;
by means of the <i>pleura</i>, from which it does not
appear to be separated by any suture, it connects the
secondary or under-wings with the hind-legs, as the scapular
does the primary ones with the mid-legs; so that
the direction of the <i>parapleura</i> depends upon the relative
situation of the legs and wings. In Coleopterous
insects its direction is <i>horizontal</i>, it being generally a narrow
subquadrangular piece that runs straight from the
posterior coxÃ¦ to the scapular<a name="FNanchor_1724_1724" id="FNanchor_1724_1724"></a><a href="#Footnote_1724_1724" class="fnanchor">[1724]</a>, and usually divided into
two unequal portions by an elevated or impressed line.
In the palm-weevil (<i>Calandra Palmarum</i>) this part is
wider than usual; in <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>,&mdash;in which genus,
as likewise in <i>Carabus</i> L., the <i>coxÃ¦</i> are incapable of
separate motion,&mdash;it is nearly a right-angled triangle,
and is divided longitudinally into two <i>unequal</i> portions.
In the <i>Orthoptera</i> Order this part usually consists of two
<i>equal</i> portions, and its direction is sometimes nearly horizontal,
as in <i>Mantis</i> and <i>Phasma</i>; sometimes forming an
angle with the horizon, as in <i>Blatta</i>; and sometimes
nearly vertical, as in <i>Locusta</i> Leach. In the two first cases
the wings are <i>before</i> the legs, and in the last their position
is <i>over</i> them. In the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>
it is parallel with the scapular, is divided into two unequal
portions, and its direction is more or less inclined
to the horizon<a name="FNanchor_1725_1725" id="FNanchor_1725_1725"></a><a href="#Footnote_1725_1725" class="fnanchor">[1725]</a>. As to the <i>Homopterous</i> section&mdash;in <i>Fulgora</i>
it is of a very irregular shape with an angular surface,
and its direction from the leg to the wing is first nearly
vertical and then horizontal: in <i>Tettigonia</i> it is almost
vertical, and consists of two nearly equal portions. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
come to the <i>Neuroptera</i>&mdash;in the <i>Libellulina</i> it consists of
two pieces, like those of the scapulars, but smaller<a name="FNanchor_1726_1726" id="FNanchor_1726_1726"></a><a href="#Footnote_1726_1726" class="fnanchor">[1726]</a>, and
its inclination is towards the head: in <i>Panorpa</i> also it
resembles the scapulars both in form and other circumstances<a name="FNanchor_1727_1727" id="FNanchor_1727_1727"></a><a href="#Footnote_1727_1727" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a>.
In the remaining Orders it exhibits no very
remarkable features.</p>

<p>16. <i>Metasternum</i><a href="#Footnote_1727_1727" class="fnanchor">[1727]</a>. The central part of the <i>mesostethium</i>
when elevated or porrected, or otherwise remarkable,
is called the <i>metasternum</i>. In the <i>Coleoptera</i>, in
those cases, as we have seen above<a name="FNanchor_1728_1728" id="FNanchor_1728_1728"></a><a href="#Footnote_1728_1728" class="fnanchor">[1728]</a>, in which the <i>medipectus</i>
and <i>postpectus</i> form one piece, its anterior point
becomes the <i>mesosternum</i>; but in others, as the Predaceous
and Capricorn-beetles, &amp;c., it is received in a sinus
or fork of that part, or meets it. It is usually neither
so remarkable nor important as the <i>mesosternum</i>. In
<i>Bolbocerus</i> K. it is a rhomboidal elevation: in <i>Gyrinus</i> a
ridge; as also in many <i>Hydrophili</i>, in which it passes
between the hind-legs to the abdomen, and terminates in
a sharp point<a name="FNanchor_1729_1729" id="FNanchor_1729_1729"></a><a href="#Footnote_1729_1729" class="fnanchor">[1729]</a>; and in <i>Dytiscus</i> its two diverging lobes
cover the base of the posterior trochanters<a name="FNanchor_1730_1730" id="FNanchor_1730_1730"></a><a href="#Footnote_1730_1730" class="fnanchor">[1730]</a>. In the
<i>Orthoptera</i> Order this part is not remarkable; but in
<i>Acrida viridissima</i> K. it consists of three triangular pieces,
the lateral ones being erect, and the intermediate one horizontal:
in <i>Locusta</i> Leach it resembles the <i>mesosternum</i><a name="FNanchor_1731_1731" id="FNanchor_1731_1731"></a><a href="#Footnote_1731_1731" class="fnanchor">[1731]</a>.
In the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i> the whole <i>mesostethium</i>
is elevated, and terminates at both ends in a fork, the
anterior one receiving the point of the <i>promuscis</i>, and the
posterior one that of the <i>epigastrium</i>: in the Homopterous
section, the <i>TettigoniÃ¦</i> F. have usually a distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
metasternal point between their hind-legs. In the remaining
Orders there is no <i>metasternum</i>, or no remarkable one,
except in one singular Hymenopterous genus, <i>Evania</i>, the
parasite of the <i>BlattÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_1732_1732" id="FNanchor_1732_1732"></a><a href="#Footnote_1732_1732" class="fnanchor">[1732]</a>, in which there is a forked posterior
process of the <i>mesostethium</i> with recurved points.</p>

<p>17. <i>Opercula</i><a name="FNanchor_1733_1733" id="FNanchor_1733_1733"></a><a href="#Footnote_1733_1733" class="fnanchor">[1733]</a>. By this term I distinguish those
plates, before largely described<a name="FNanchor_1734_1734" id="FNanchor_1734_1734"></a><a href="#Footnote_1734_1734" class="fnanchor">[1734]</a>, which cover the drums
of male <i>TettigoniÃ¦</i> F.; and likewise those called also by
the same name by M. Chabrier<a name="FNanchor_1735_1735" id="FNanchor_1735_1735"></a><a href="#Footnote_1735_1735" class="fnanchor">[1735]</a>, which cover, in many
cases, the <i>vocal apparatus</i> of the trunk of insects: those
of <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i> he describes as situated below the
wings, and between the two segments of the <i>alitrunk</i><a name="FNanchor_1736_1736" id="FNanchor_1736_1736"></a><a href="#Footnote_1736_1736" class="fnanchor">[1736]</a>;
and if you take this insect and remove the elytra, the
<i>mesothorax</i> and scapulars, under the latter and below the
wing you will find an oval convex plate, which is probably
the part he is speaking of;&mdash;but it is better exemplified,
I think, in the common <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>, in
which it is very distinct as a convex subtriangular plate
connected with the <i>metathorax</i> by membranous ligament,
covering a kind of pouch, and appearing to open and
shut at the vertex<a name="FNanchor_1737_1737" id="FNanchor_1737_1737"></a><a href="#Footnote_1737_1737" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I must here observe, with regard to the <i>Aptera</i> and
<i>Arachnida</i>, that the trunk in them is much more simple
than in those insects that are furnished with <i>wings</i>. In
the hexapods, in the former Orders, though there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
usually three pedigerous segments, there is no distinction
of <i>dorsolum</i>, <i>scutellum</i>, &amp;c. In the <i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i> and
<i>Scutigera</i> amongst the Myriapods, according to the acute
observations of M. Savigny<a name="FNanchor_1738_1738" id="FNanchor_1738_1738"></a><a href="#Footnote_1738_1738" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a>,&mdash;on which, however, some
doubt at present rests,&mdash;there is a remarkable formation,
the whole thorax being represented by the single plate
that follows the head, to the under-side of which are attached
the first and second pair of <i>palpi</i> or <i>pedipalpi</i>,
and the first pair of legs, representing the three pairs of
legs of hexapods. In the <i>IulidÃ¦</i> the three segments that
follow the head, each bear a <i>single</i> pair of legs, while all
the rest bear a <i>double</i> one: from whence it should seem
to follow, that these segments and their legs represent
the trunk and legs of Hexapods. In the Octopod <i>Aptera</i>
and the <i>Arachnida</i> the trunk consists of a single piece,
not separated from the head, and sometimes not distinct
from the abdomen.</p>


<p>V. <i>Internal processes</i><a name="FNanchor_1739_1739" id="FNanchor_1739_1739"></a><a href="#Footnote_1739_1739" class="fnanchor">[1739]</a>. Perhaps you will think that
this head would be better considered when I treat of the
<i>Internal Anatomy of Insects</i>; but as the parts included
under it are really processes of the <i>external integument</i>
of the trunk, it seemed to me best to treat of them under
that head. They are of two descriptions; processes of
the <i>thorax</i> or upper part of the trunk, and processes of
the <i>breast</i> or its under part.</p>

<p>i. <i>Processes of the thorax</i><a name="FNanchor_1740_1740" id="FNanchor_1740_1740"></a><a href="#Footnote_1740_1740" class="fnanchor">[1740]</a>. These are the <i>phragma</i>,
<i>prophragma</i>, <i>mesophragma</i>, and <i>metaphragma</i>. The first
belongs to the <i>prothorax</i>, the second to the <i>mesothorax</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
and the two last to the <i>metathorax</i>; each forming a kind of
chamber of the under-side of each segment of the thorax.</p>

<p>1. <i>Phragma</i>. The <i>phragm</i>, or <i>septum</i> of the <i>prothorax</i>,
is most conspicuous in the mole-cricket (<i>Gryllotalpa</i>),
in which it is a hairy ligament attached to the inside
of the upper and lateral margins of the base of that part:
inclining inwards, it forms the cavity which receives
the <i>mesothorax</i>. It is not, however, without a representative
in many <i>Coleoptera</i>, though in these it is less striking,
from its being smaller and taking a horizontal direction.
In <i>Elater</i>, by means of some prominent points received
by corresponding cavities of the vertical part of the base
of the elytrum, it forms a kind of ginglymous articulation,
which probably keeps them from dislocation in repose,
and, by the sudden disengagement of these points
from the cavities, assists the animal in jumping<a name="FNanchor_1741_1741" id="FNanchor_1741_1741"></a><a href="#Footnote_1741_1741" class="fnanchor">[1741]</a>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Prophragma</i><a name="FNanchor_1742_1742" id="FNanchor_1742_1742"></a><a href="#Footnote_1742_1742" class="fnanchor">[1742]</a>. This is a piece usually almost vertical,
but in <i>Elater</i> horizontal; of a substance between
membrane and cartilage, descending anteriorly from the
<i>dorsolum</i>, and forming the first partition of the chest of
the <i>mesothorax</i>; it is generally much shorter than the
mesophragm. Though very visible in <i>Coleoptera</i> and
the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, in the other Orders it is
less easily detected, and is sometimes obsolete. It may
be observed here, that in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, at least in
the wasp, the hive-bee, the humble-bee, and the <i>Diptera</i>
mostly, the interior of the upper-side of the alitrunk,
instead of <i>two</i>, seems at first to be divided into <i>four</i> chambers,
formed by <i>septula</i>: but as these ridges merely mark
out the internal limits of the <i>dorsolum</i>, <i>scutellum</i>, <i>postdorsolum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
and <i>metapnystega</i>, the last but one of these being
usually less distinct, they seem not analogous to the three
partitions of the alitrunk in other Orders; so that in
these the mesophragm at least seems to have no representative,
and the prophragm and metaphragm include
between them only one ample chamber. In the <i>Diptera</i>,
wherever there is an external <i>depression</i> or <i>suture</i> there
is a corresponding internal <i>ridge</i> or seam, so that the
parts seem more distinctly marked out on the <i>inside</i>
than on the <i>outside</i> of the crust.</p>

<p>3. <i>Mesophragma</i><a name="FNanchor_1743_1743" id="FNanchor_1743_1743"></a><a href="#Footnote_1743_1743" class="fnanchor">[1743]</a>. This piece also, which forms the
middle partition of the upper part of the cavity of the
alitrunk, dividing it into two chambers, is most conspicuous
in <i>Coleoptera</i>. It is usually in them a vertical
piece, resembling the prophragm in substance, but twice
its height, of a quadrangular shape with a notch in the
middle; it fills the sinus of the <i>postdorsolum</i>, the sides of
which sometimes descend below it<a name="FNanchor_1744_1744" id="FNanchor_1744_1744"></a><a href="#Footnote_1744_1744" class="fnanchor">[1744]</a>. In this Order the
chamber that it forms with the prophragm is very small<a name="FNanchor_1745_1745" id="FNanchor_1745_1745"></a><a href="#Footnote_1745_1745" class="fnanchor">[1745]</a>,
the motions of the elytra requiring no powerful apparatus
of muscles; but that which it forms with the metaphragm,
which is appropriated to the muscles moving the wings,
is very large<a name="FNanchor_1746_1746" id="FNanchor_1746_1746"></a><a href="#Footnote_1746_1746" class="fnanchor">[1746]</a>. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> the anterior chamber
is larger than in the preceding Order, which proves that
<i>tegmina</i> are more moved in flight than <i>elytra</i>. In the
Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i> a remarkable variation takes
place&mdash;the anterior being larger than the posterior
chamber; which last, in fact, consists of two, one for each
wing: in these the mesophragm towards the abdomen
forms an angle, which in <i>Pentatoma</i>, &amp;c., is acute; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
<i>Belostoma</i> a right angle, and in <i>Notonecta</i> an obtuse
one. In the two first the angle of the mesophragm sends
two short diverging ridges to the metaphragm; and in
the last only a single one: in this also the posterior
chambers together are nearly as large as the anterior.
From this structure it should seem that in flight the
<i>Hemelytra</i> are more important than the wings. In the
Homopterous section the anterior chamber is the
smallest, at least in <i>Fulgora candelaria</i>; and the mesophragm
is lofty and bipartite. In the <i>Lepidoptera</i> the
anterior chamber is the largest, and the part in question
conspicuous<a name="FNanchor_1747_1747" id="FNanchor_1747_1747"></a><a href="#Footnote_1747_1747" class="fnanchor">[1747]</a>. In the <i>Libellulina</i> and <i>Hymenoptera</i> it
is merely represented by a low ridge, and in the <i>Diptera</i>
it seems evanescent.</p>

<p>4. <i>Metaphragma</i><a name="FNanchor_1748_1748" id="FNanchor_1748_1748"></a><a href="#Footnote_1748_1748" class="fnanchor">[1748]</a>. This, in many cases, is the largest
and most remarkable of the three partitions of the upper
portion of the cavity of the alitrunk, which separates it
from that of the abdomen; it is attached to the posterior
margin of the <i>metathorax</i>, and is nearly vertical: in substance
it may be stated as rather firmer than the two
preceding partitions. In the <i>Coleoptera</i> it is commonly
of the width of the posterior orifice of the alitrunk; and
its centre is cleft so as to form a deep sinus<a name="FNanchor_1749_1749" id="FNanchor_1749_1749"></a><a href="#Footnote_1749_1749" class="fnanchor">[1749]</a> for the
transmission of the intestines,&mdash;a circumstance which
also, though less conspicuously, distinguishes the mesophragm<a name="FNanchor_1750_1750" id="FNanchor_1750_1750"></a><a href="#Footnote_1750_1750" class="fnanchor">[1750]</a>:
from this sinus it slopes gradually towards the
sides, and is sometimes armed with an intermediate process
on each side<a name="FNanchor_1751_1751" id="FNanchor_1751_1751"></a><a href="#Footnote_1751_1751" class="fnanchor">[1751]</a>. This structure you will find exemplified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>
in the common cock-chafer and many others of
the Order. I have not, however, discovered traces of
it either in the <i>SilphidÃ¦</i>, <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, or the vesicatory
beetles (<i>Meloe</i> L.); or even in such species of <i>Carabus</i>
L. and <i>Cicindela</i> L. that I have examined; while in
<i>Dytiscus</i> it is very visible. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> it is nearly
obsolete; but in <i>Locusta</i> Leach, under the <i>metapnystega</i>,
one on each side, is a pair of seemingly <i>pneumatic</i>
pouches which may be mistaken for it. It is almost
equally inconspicuous in both sections of the <i>Hemiptera</i>.
As to the <i>Lepidoptera</i>,&mdash;in <i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>, it resembles
in some degree, though in miniature, the metaphragm of
the <i>Coleoptera</i>; but in <i>Sphinx Stellatarum</i> and <i>Lasiocampa
Quercus</i> it has a sinus on each side, but no middle
one. In <i>Panorpa</i> it nearly closes the posterior orifice
of the trunk, but in the <i>Libellulina</i> it is a mere ridge.
In some <i>Hymenoptera</i>, as <i>Cimbex sericea</i>, the drone-bee at
least, &amp;c., it is a large convex bifid piece. In the wasps,
under the spiracle of the <i>metapnystega</i> on each side,
as in the <i>Locusta</i>, is what I also take to be a pneumatic
pouch, which might easily be mistaken for a metaphragm.
In the <i>Diptera</i> Order this part is very conspicuous. If
you remove the abdomen of any common <i>Tipula</i>, you
will find that the posterior orifice of the trunk is closed
above by a pair of oblong, vertical, convex, diverging
plates;&mdash;do the same by any fly (<i>Musca</i> L.), and you will
detect in the same situation a very large convex or gibbous
one notched below, which occupies almost the whole
orifice: this is the metaphragm.</p>

<p>5. <i>Septula</i><a name="FNanchor_1752_1752" id="FNanchor_1752_1752"></a><a href="#Footnote_1752_1752" class="fnanchor">[1752]</a>. These are the <i>smaller</i> ridges of the interior
of the alitrunk, which afford a point of attachment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
many muscles, and run in various directions both on the
interior of the crust and of the metaphragm. These little
seams are not to be found so generally in the other Orders;
but very frequently, as has been before observed,
where there is an exterior impression of the crust, or a
suture, one of these forms its internal base.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Processes of the pectus</i><a name="FNanchor_1753_1753" id="FNanchor_1753_1753"></a><a href="#Footnote_1753_1753" class="fnanchor">[1753]</a>. We are next to consider
the internal processes of the <i>breast</i> of insects: these consist
for the most part of the <i>endosternum</i>, or <i>internal</i>
sternum, and its branches. As the principal feature of
this are the processes which rising from it serve as points
of attachment to the muscles that move the legs, &amp;c., I
shall confine myself to them&mdash;they are, the <i>antefurca</i>, the
<i>medifurca</i>, and the <i>postfurca</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Antefurca</i><a name="FNanchor_1754_1754" id="FNanchor_1754_1754"></a><a href="#Footnote_1754_1754" class="fnanchor">[1754]</a>. The first portion of the <i>endosternum</i>,
or the internal <i>prosternum</i>, branches into the <i>antefurca</i>.
In the <i>Coleoptera</i> a plate varying in shape and direction<a name="FNanchor_1755_1755" id="FNanchor_1755_1755"></a><a href="#Footnote_1755_1755" class="fnanchor">[1755]</a>
sends forth a pair of mostly vertical processes of a cartilaginous
substance<a name="FNanchor_1756_1756" id="FNanchor_1756_1756"></a><a href="#Footnote_1756_1756" class="fnanchor">[1756]</a>, differing in height in different
genera. In <i>Carabus</i> L. there is neither this plate nor its
processes; but in <i>Dytiscus</i> the latter are very visible. A
very singular and complex machine represents the part
we are considering in that extraordinary insect the mole-cricket
(<i>Gryllotalpa</i> Latr.). When we look at its prodigious
arms and consider their office<a name="FNanchor_1757_1757" id="FNanchor_1757_1757"></a><a href="#Footnote_1757_1757" class="fnanchor">[1757]</a>, we may imagine that
the requisite apparatus for moving them must be very
powerful and peculiar. Their <span class="smcap">Creator</span> has accordingly
provided them with a machine for this purpose more
than usually complex, extending from the <i>prothorax</i> to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
<i>prosternum</i>; the former being its <i>base</i>, and the latter its
<i>vertex</i>. The cavity of the manitrunk is divided longitudinally
by a double cartilaginous partition surmounted
by a bony frame, with an anterior condyle or tuberosity,
with which the inner part of the base of the clavicle of the
arm appears to ginglymate; and the manitrunk is preserved
from the injury the powerful action of the arm
might occasion, by the counteraction of this machine, to
describe which fully, would demand more space than I
can afford<a name="FNanchor_1758_1758" id="FNanchor_1758_1758"></a><a href="#Footnote_1758_1758" class="fnanchor">[1758]</a>. I mentioned under the <i>mesostethium</i>, the apertures
visible in the breast of <i>Locusta</i> Leach and <i>Acrida</i> K.
Each of these apertures opens into an internal, tubular,
horny, process, which arching off is attached at the
other extremity to the sides of the trunk&mdash;a pair being
appropriated to each segment; the first analogous to
the <i>antefurca</i>, the second to the <i>medifurca</i>, and the last
to the <i>postfurca</i>. In the <i>medipectus</i> and <i>postpectus</i> of
<i>Acrida viridissima</i> there is only a single aperture, terminating
in a single tube, which after rising vertically a
little way sends off a branch on either hand to the sides
of the trunk. Where there are <i>three</i> of these holes, as
in the <i>antepectus</i> and <i>medipectus</i> of <i>Locusta Dux</i>, there
are <i>three</i> of these processes, the intermediate one being
vertical. In the subsequent Orders the processes of the
<i>endosternum</i> are not sufficiently remarkable to require
particular notice: my further observations upon them
will therefore be confined to the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order.</p>

<p>2. <i>Medifurca</i><a name="FNanchor_1759_1759" id="FNanchor_1759_1759"></a><a href="#Footnote_1759_1759" class="fnanchor">[1759]</a>. This part, which belongs to the mid-legs,
is in many cases more conspicuous than the <i>antefurca</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
In <i>Copris Molossus</i> the <i>endosternum</i> of the <i>medipectus</i> is
represented by a transverse zigzag ridge<a name="FNanchor_1760_1760" id="FNanchor_1760_1760"></a><a href="#Footnote_1760_1760" class="fnanchor">[1760]</a> between the
sockets of the mid-coxÃ¦, from which proceeds a pair of
branches wide at the base and growing gradually more
slender to the extremity<a name="FNanchor_1761_1761" id="FNanchor_1761_1761"></a><a href="#Footnote_1761_1761" class="fnanchor">[1761]</a>, which is attached to the sides
of the trunk; in <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i> a pair of slender, vertical,
straight processes, fitted with a broad cartilaginous
plate at their apex, rises from the <i>endosternum</i>, and sends
forth a lateral one to the side of the <i>medipectus:</i> and lastly,
in <i>Carabus</i> the <i>medifurca</i> is represented by a pair of subtriangular
<i>laminÃ¦</i> attached to the sides of the trunk.</p>

<p>3. <i>Postfurca</i><a name="FNanchor_1762_1762" id="FNanchor_1762_1762"></a><a href="#Footnote_1762_1762" class="fnanchor">[1762]</a>. This, which belongs to the hind-legs,
is the most remarkable of the pectoral processes,
and has been noticed by more than one writer<a name="FNanchor_1763_1763" id="FNanchor_1763_1763"></a><a href="#Footnote_1763_1763" class="fnanchor">[1763]</a>. It is
a kind of trident, the branches<a name="FNanchor_1764_1764" id="FNanchor_1764_1764"></a><a href="#Footnote_1764_1764" class="fnanchor">[1764]</a> of which are acute, and
on their upper surface longitudinally concave, elevated
on a footstalk<a name="FNanchor_1765_1765" id="FNanchor_1765_1765"></a><a href="#Footnote_1765_1765" class="fnanchor">[1765]</a> inclined towards the <i>medifurca</i>, consisting
of two plates, a posterior one supporting the lateral
branches, and an anterior or interior one forming a right
angle with the other, supporting the intermediate one.
This footstalk rises from between the posterior <i>coxÃ¦</i>,
which appear in the Lamellicorns to ginglymate with it at
its base. The middle branch of the trident dips to the
sinus of the <i>medifurca</i>. In <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i> the form
is different; for the intermediate branch consists of two
parallel pieces, and the lateral ones are dilated into broad
vertical plates: the stalk of this is triquetrous, and a triple
cartilaginous partition appears to go from its base
anteriorly, the lateral ones diverging to the sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
trunk, and the intermediate one running straight to the
base of the <i>medifurca</i>.</p>

<p>It may not be without interest to state here some of
the several objects and uses of this structure of the
trunk. When our Saviour says to his disciples, "But
even the very hairs of your head are all numbered"<a name="FNanchor_1766_1766" id="FNanchor_1766_1766"></a><a href="#Footnote_1766_1766" class="fnanchor">[1766]</a>&mdash;he
taught them that the attention and care of the <span class="smcap">Deity</span>
were not confined to the mighty and the vast, but
directed to every atom of his creation&mdash;that he not only
decreed the number and magnitude of the planets and
planetary systems, and of their various inhabitants, but
that the most minute and apparently insignificant part
of each individual, both as to its number and form, was
according to the law by him laid down; and whoever
studies them with attention will find that insects furnish a
very interesting homily upon this text; since in various
instances I think I have made it clear, that parts seemingly
of the least importance&mdash;as a hair, a pore, or a
slight impression&mdash;have their appropriate use<a name="FNanchor_1767_1767" id="FNanchor_1767_1767"></a><a href="#Footnote_1767_1767" class="fnanchor">[1767]</a>. At first,
it would seem that the various pieces of which we have
seen the second primary segment of the trunk of these
animals to be composed, would be of little importance;
but when we reflect that this multiplicity of parts is
usually not to be found in those that have no wings,
whether they be apterous sexes or tribes<a name="FNanchor_1768_1768" id="FNanchor_1768_1768"></a><a href="#Footnote_1768_1768" class="fnanchor">[1768]</a>, a suspicion
arises in the mind that they must be of more consequence
than their <i>prima facie</i> appearance seems to warrant:&mdash;and
this is really the case. The <i>manitrunk</i>, which is destined
principally to incase the muscles that move the <i>arms</i>,
did not require to be so complex as the part that had to
support the action of <i>wings</i> as well as <i>legs</i>. In those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
have a large <i>prothorax</i>, as the <i>Coleoptera</i>, it may, indeed,
be useful in flight as a counterpoise to the abdomen;
and since when the wings descend it rises, and <i>vice versa</i>,
it may be of some service by its vibrations<a name="FNanchor_1769_1769" id="FNanchor_1769_1769"></a><a href="#Footnote_1769_1769" class="fnanchor">[1769]</a>; but for this
it required no complexity of structure. But not so the
<i>alitrunk</i>: it consists of parts much more numerous, and
this number of parts is of great importance to the animal
in its flight. All of them are so put together, being lined
by a common elastic ligament<a name="FNanchor_1770_1770" id="FNanchor_1770_1770"></a><a href="#Footnote_1770_1770" class="fnanchor">[1770]</a>, as to be capable of a
certain degree of tension and relaxation, which enables
the animal to compress or dilate the trunk as its necessities
require. To cause the elevation of the wings,
it must be <i>compressed</i> or have its <i>longitudinal</i> diameter
<i>increased</i>, and its <i>vertical</i> and <i>transverse diminished</i>:
this compression is produced by the <i>condensation</i> of
the internal air, which parts with some of its caloric, and
by the action of the <i>levator</i> muscles. To cause the <i>depression</i>
of the wings, it must be <i>dilated</i>, or have its <i>longitudinal</i>
diameter <i>diminished</i>, and its <i>vertical</i> and <i>transverse
increased</i>, which is effected by the <i>rarefaction</i> of
the internal air, and the action of the <i>depressor</i> muscles<a name="FNanchor_1771_1771" id="FNanchor_1771_1771"></a><a href="#Footnote_1771_1771" class="fnanchor">[1771]</a>.
In some Orders, the <i>Coleoptera</i>, &amp;c., this effect is promoted
by the segments of the trunk, which are attached
by loose ligamentous membranes, and received, one or
more of them, into each other, which facilitates the
above action<a name="FNanchor_1772_1772" id="FNanchor_1772_1772"></a><a href="#Footnote_1772_1772" class="fnanchor">[1772]</a>. Thus much for the general use of these
parts. I shall further here mention a partial one of
two of them which seems indicated by a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
circumstance, and upon which a theory may be built. In
some insects the primary and secondary wings or their
analogues are placed <i>before</i> the legs, in others <i>over</i> the
legs, and in others <i>behind</i> the legs: but whatever their
position, the pieces which I have named the <i>scapularia</i>
and <i>parapleurÃ¦</i> invariably connect the one with the
other; the former, the <i>primary</i> wings with the <i>mid-legs</i>,
and the latter, the <i>secondary</i> wings with the <i>hind-legs</i>.
This circumstance seems to prove that the wings by the
intervention of these pieces have an action upon the legs,
and the legs upon the wings; and this is further proved
in one case by an observation of M. Chabrier with regard
to <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>,&mdash;that the levator muscles of
the wings, by means of a long tendon, are attached to
the lower part of the posterior coxÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_1773_1773" id="FNanchor_1773_1773"></a><a href="#Footnote_1773_1773" class="fnanchor">[1773]</a>. Now, more than
one medical friend has suggested to me, that what are
called the <i>coxÃ¦</i> in insects are really analogous to the
<i>thighs</i> of vertebrate animals<a name="FNanchor_1774_1774" id="FNanchor_1774_1774"></a><a href="#Footnote_1774_1774" class="fnanchor">[1774]</a>: consequently these parts
must represent the <i>coxÃ¦</i>; whence it would seem that the
wings are really appendages of the legs. It must, however,
be observed, that were this opinion admitted, in the
<i>Aptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, and <i>Diptera</i>, or even in the <i>prothorax</i>
of other insects, there would scarcely be any analogue
of the <i>coxÃ¦</i> at all distinct from the trunk itself, of
which even in the other Orders these pieces are component
parts. An instance occurs in the <i>Strepsiptera</i> K.,
and in which the arms are furnished with an alary appendage,
and the <i>metathorax</i> has none<a name="FNanchor_1775_1775" id="FNanchor_1775_1775"></a><a href="#Footnote_1775_1775" class="fnanchor">[1775]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span></p>
<p>VI. <i>Organs of Motion.</i> We are next to consider those
organs attached to the trunk of insects which are instruments
of <i>motion</i>. These are principally those by which they
are transported through the <i>air</i>, and those by which they
move on the <i>earth</i> or in the <i>water</i>&mdash;their <i>wings</i> and their
<i>legs</i>. I shall begin with the first, the <i>wings</i><a name="FNanchor_1776_1776" id="FNanchor_1776_1776"></a><a href="#Footnote_1776_1776" class="fnanchor">[1776]</a>. These
are not formed precisely after any type at present discovered
in vertebrate animals: in some respects they
have an analogy to those of birds<a name="FNanchor_1777_1777" id="FNanchor_1777_1777"></a><a href="#Footnote_1777_1777" class="fnanchor">[1777]</a>; in others, to the
dorsal fins of fishes: but, perhaps, altogether they approach
the nearest to those of the dragon or flying-lizard
(<i>Draco volans</i> L.), which do not, as in birds, replace the
fore-legs, are kept expanded by diverging bony rays,
and are connected with the hind-legs<a name="FNanchor_1778_1778" id="FNanchor_1778_1778"></a><a href="#Footnote_1778_1778" class="fnanchor">[1778]</a>. As the Divine
Creator appears in his works to proceed gradually from
one type of structure to another, it has been supposed
by a learned physiologist of our own country, that in
winged insects, <i>four</i> of the legs of the Decapod <i>Crustacea</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
are represented by the four wings<a name="FNanchor_1779_1779" id="FNanchor_1779_1779"></a><a href="#Footnote_1779_1779" class="fnanchor">[1779]</a>: this opinion, however,
is not yet fully proved; a remark which may also be
applied to a more recent one of a celebrated French
writer, who seems to think their origin and structure
aÃ«rostatic, that they are auxiliary to the legs, and borrowed
in part from the respiratory organs<a name="FNanchor_1780_1780" id="FNanchor_1780_1780"></a><a href="#Footnote_1780_1780" class="fnanchor">[1780]</a>. Were I
disposed to enter into these subtile speculations, I might
here recall your attention to the analogy that, in their
metamorphoses, exists between the <i>Saurian Reptiles</i> or
lizard tribe and insects, and conjecture that the wings of
the <i>Draco</i> are really representatives of the mid-legs of
Hexapods, thus preparing to disappear altogether; but
I shall content myself with throwing out this hint, which
you are welcome to pursue. The organs of flight in
general may be considered as to their <i>number</i>, <i>kinds</i>, and
<i>composition</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Number.</i> The most natural number is <i>four</i>, for this
obtains in the majority. In almost every Order, indeed,
there occur instances of insects that have solely a single
pair or none<a name="FNanchor_1781_1781" id="FNanchor_1781_1781"></a><a href="#Footnote_1781_1781" class="fnanchor">[1781]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span></p>

<p>These, however, are only exceptions to the rule; but in
the <i>Diptera</i>, unless we consider the <i>alulÃ¦</i>, the representatives
of the secondary wings<a name="FNanchor_1782_1782" id="FNanchor_1782_1782"></a><a href="#Footnote_1782_1782" class="fnanchor">[1782]</a>, as a distinct pair, there
are never more than <i>two</i> wings, and one instance is
known in which an insect of this Order has <i>none</i><a name="FNanchor_1783_1783" id="FNanchor_1783_1783"></a><a href="#Footnote_1783_1783" class="fnanchor">[1783]</a>.
Certain genera or individuals of the Tetrapterous Orders
are also furnished with <i>alulÃ¦</i>: besides <i>Dytiscus</i>, <i>Blatta</i>,
<i>PhalÃ¦na hexaptera</i>, which have been before noticed<a name="FNanchor_1784_1784" id="FNanchor_1784_1784"></a><a href="#Footnote_1784_1784" class="fnanchor">[1784]</a>,
they may be detected in miniature in <i>Ammophila</i> K. and
affinities; these all may be regarded in some slight degree
as insects with <i>six wings</i>.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Kinds.</i> Under this head we may consider the organs
of flight as to their <i>situation</i> and as to their <i>substance</i>.
As to their <i>situation</i>, usually the first pair are
attached to the <i>mesothorax</i>, and the second to the <i>metathorax</i>;
but in one instance, as has been before observed<a name="FNanchor_1785_1785" id="FNanchor_1785_1785"></a><a href="#Footnote_1785_1785" class="fnanchor">[1785]</a>,
in the <i>Strepsiptera</i> K., the anterior pair belong
to the <i>manitrunk</i>, and the posterior to the <i>mesothorax</i>.
As to their substance, they take the several denominations
of <i>elytra</i>, <i>tegmina</i>, <i>hemelytra</i>, and <i>wings</i>, for the
most part according to its variations, as will be seen
more at large hereafter. Under this head I shall only
further observe, that in many instances the organs of
flight appear to be mere <i>abortions</i> or <i>rudiments</i>, which
serve to exemplify what has been more than once stated,
that the CREATOR has seen it good to approach to new
organs gradually as well as to new forms. Thus <i>elytra</i> are
mere rudiments that do not serve to protect the wings in
<i>Atractocerus</i>; <i>tegmina</i> in some species of <i>Phasma</i>, <i>Acrydium</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
&amp;c.; <i>hemelytra</i> in the bed-bug<a name="FNanchor_1786_1786" id="FNanchor_1786_1786"></a><a href="#Footnote_1786_1786" class="fnanchor">[1786]</a>; <i>wings</i> in many
female moths, in <i>Cryptus hemipterus</i> a <i>Hymenopterous</i>
insect, &amp;c.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Composition.</i> The structure of wings has been
before explained to you<a name="FNanchor_1787_1787" id="FNanchor_1787_1787"></a><a href="#Footnote_1787_1787" class="fnanchor">[1787]</a>, and I shall again have occasion
to allude to it; but here I wish to call your attention
to a circumstance that has not hitherto, that I recollect,
been adverted to; I mean that all kinds of organs of
flight, and it may be traced as we shall soon see even in
elytra, are divided longitudinally into three <i>areas</i> or folds;
the first or external one I call the <i>Costal Area</i><a name="FNanchor_1788_1788" id="FNanchor_1788_1788"></a><a href="#Footnote_1788_1788" class="fnanchor">[1788]</a> from its
beginning with the costal nervure; the second is the <i>Intermediate
Area</i><a name="FNanchor_1789_1789" id="FNanchor_1789_1789"></a><a href="#Footnote_1789_1789" class="fnanchor">[1789]</a>; and the third is the <i>Anal Area</i><a name="FNanchor_1790_1790" id="FNanchor_1790_1790"></a><a href="#Footnote_1790_1790" class="fnanchor">[1790]</a>.</p>

<p>Having made these observations with respect to the
organs of flight in general, I shall now proceed to consider
more at large the <i>elytra</i>, <i>tegmina</i>, <i>hemelytra</i>, and <i>wings</i>.</p>


<p>i. <i>Elytra.</i> These are the wing-covers of the <i>Coleoptera</i>
Order, distinguished from <i>tegmina</i> by the absence of
<i>nervures</i>, from <i>hemelytra</i> by the want of the membrane
at the apex, and from both by their uniting in almost
every instance at the suture. I shall consider them as
to their <i>substance</i>; <i>articulation</i> with the <i>trunk</i>; <i>expansion</i>;
<i>parts</i>; <i>shape</i>; <i>appendages</i>; <i>sculpture</i>; <i>clothing</i>;
<i>colours</i>, and <i>uses</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Substance.</i> The firmness of the substance of elytra
is usually regulated by that of the crust of the insect to
which they belong; in hard insects they are hard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
in soft ones they also are soft. The most impenetrable
ones that occur to my recollection are those of Illiger's
genus <i>Doryphora</i>, and the softest and most flexile those
of <i>Telephorus</i>, <i>Meloe</i> and affinities. With regard to individuals,
they are mostly as hard as the <i>prothorax</i>, and
harder than the <i>back</i> of the abdomen. Elytra also, as
far as my observation goes, are never diaphanous.</p>

<p>2. <i>Articulation with the trunk.</i> This is by means of
a process of the base of the elytrum which I call the <i>axis</i><a name="FNanchor_1791_1791" id="FNanchor_1791_1791"></a><a href="#Footnote_1791_1791" class="fnanchor">[1791]</a>
or pivot, attached by elastic ligaments, and certain little
bony pieces (<i>osselets</i> Chabr.) in the socket under the side
of the anterior angle of the <i>dorsolum</i><a name="FNanchor_1792_1792" id="FNanchor_1792_1792"></a><a href="#Footnote_1792_1792" class="fnanchor">[1792]</a>. You may easily
remove the elytra attached to the <i>mesothorax</i> from <i>Geotrupes
stercorarius</i>, which will enable you to see the mode
of articulation with little trouble<a name="FNanchor_1793_1793" id="FNanchor_1793_1793"></a><a href="#Footnote_1793_1793" class="fnanchor">[1793]</a>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Expansion.</i> It is by means of the bony pieces just
mentioned that the organs in question are opened and
shut<a name="FNanchor_1794_1794" id="FNanchor_1794_1794"></a><a href="#Footnote_1794_1794" class="fnanchor">[1794]</a> under the action of the antagonist muscles. In
opening for flight the two elytra recede from each other,
and are elevated so as not to retain their horizontal position,
which would interfere probably with the play of
the wings, but form an angle with the body. When they
return to a state of rest, the sutures usually meet and
coincide longitudinally; but in some cases when closed,
as in <i>Necydalis</i>, &amp;c., they diverge from each other at the
apex; and in <i>Meloe</i>, like the <i>Orthoptera</i>, to which that
genus approaches, one laps over the other.</p>

<p>4. <i>Parts.</i> The parts to be considered in an elytrum
are the <i>areas</i>, the <i>axis</i>, the <i>suture</i>, the <i>margin</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
<i>epipleura</i>, the <i>base</i> and <i>apex</i>, the <i>angles</i>, and the <i>hypoderma</i>.
At first it should seem as if an <i>elytrum</i> was not like other
wings divided into areas; but I think upon examination
it will be found that, though often nearly obsolete, these
are represented in it; for the <i>epipleura</i><a name="FNanchor_1795_1795" id="FNanchor_1795_1795"></a><a href="#Footnote_1795_1795" class="fnanchor">[1795]</a> with the recurved
part of the external margin seems to me analogous to the
<i>Costal</i> Area; the inflexed part adjoining the scutellum and
often going beyond it to the <i>Anal</i>, and the rest of the organ
to the Intermediate. All this you may see in the dung-chafer,
<i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>. The <i>axis</i><a name="FNanchor_1796_1796" id="FNanchor_1796_1796"></a><a href="#Footnote_1796_1796" class="fnanchor">[1796]</a> or pivot by which
the elytrum articulates with the trunk is generally placed
about the middle of its base, but nearer the scutellar
than the humeral angle, and varies in length and shape
in the different tribes, but not so as to merit particular
notice; it may be regarded as composed of <i>three</i> parallel
pieces, one belonging to each area, that of the <i>costal</i> being
the longest. In many these pieces are marked by no
line of distinction, but in <i>Macropus</i>, &amp;c., they may be readily
traced<a name="FNanchor_1797_1797" id="FNanchor_1797_1797"></a><a href="#Footnote_1797_1797" class="fnanchor">[1797]</a>. The <i>suture</i><a name="FNanchor_1798_1798" id="FNanchor_1798_1798"></a><a href="#Footnote_1798_1798" class="fnanchor">[1798]</a> is the <i>internal</i> margin of the
elytrum from the point of the scutellum to the end. In
many beetles the right hand suture, looking from the
anus to the head, has a lower ledge or margin, and the
other, one more elevated, which when they are closed
lies upon the former; in some <i>DynastidÃ¦</i> there seems a
kind of ginglymous structure in this part, each suture
being fitted with a kind of ridge which is received by
a channel of the other; in these the suture is generally
marked out by an adjacent channel: but the most remarkable
structure of this part distinguishes the genuine
species of the genus <i>Chlamys</i>, in which both the sutures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
except at their base, are armed with little teeth, alternating
with each other like the cogs of a mill-wheel. In
apterous beetles the elytra are often <i>connate</i>, or have
both sutures as it were soldered together. The margin<a name="FNanchor_1799_1799" id="FNanchor_1799_1799"></a><a href="#Footnote_1799_1799" class="fnanchor">[1799]</a>
or external edge of the elytra is generally formed by a bead
or ridge, which, except in the case of the truncated ones,
in which it is straight, curves more or less from the base to
the apex; this ridge is often recurved so as to form a kind
of channel between it and the disk of the elytrum, as may
be seen in the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>; in some there are two parallel
ridges, as in <i>Copris</i>; in <i>Silpha</i> the margin is dilated; in
<i>HelÃ¦us</i> and <i>Cossyphus</i> it is remarkably so and recurved,
so that, in conjunction with those of the <i>prothorax</i> which
are similarly circumstanced, they give the animal some resemblance
to a small model of a barge. Though the margin
of elytra is most commonly intire, yet in some beetles, as
<i>Gymnopleurus</i> Illig., a sinus is taken out of it; in <i>Cetonia</i>
it often projects at the <i>base</i>, and in <i>Cryptocephalus</i> in the
<i>middle</i>, into a lobe; in <i>Phoberus</i> MacLeay it is denticulated,
and in many <i>Buprestes</i> more or less serrulated;
sometimes it terminates before it reaches the apex of the
elytrum in a tooth, as in many <i>Carabi</i> Latr. The <i>epipleura</i><a name="FNanchor_1800_1800" id="FNanchor_1800_1800"></a><a href="#Footnote_1800_1800" class="fnanchor">[1800]</a>
or side-cover is that part of the organ in question,
below the margin, with which it usually forms an
angle, being more or less inflexed, that covers the sides
of the body. It varies in different tribes, being sometimes
obsolete, as in the weevils (<i>Curculio</i> L.); in the
Capricorn beetles it is very narrow; in <i>Carabus</i>, &amp;c.,
dilated at the base; in many Heteromerous beetles, as
<i>Blaps</i>, <i>Pimelia</i>, &amp;c., it is very wide and conspicuous; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
<i>Cossyphus</i> it stands out a little from the abdomen, so as
to form a kind of fence round it. Its <i>shape</i> generally approaches
that of a scythe, being incurved and growing more
slender towards the apex<a name="FNanchor_1801_1801" id="FNanchor_1801_1801"></a><a href="#Footnote_1801_1801" class="fnanchor">[1801]</a>; but it is sometimes straighter
and shorter. In <i>Geotrupes</i> and many other Lamellicorns,
the <i>base</i> of the elytrum is nearly vertical, forming a
right angle with the rest of it; it is usually transverse and
straight; but in <i>Calandra Palmarum</i> and many <i>CassidÃ¦</i>
it slants to the scutellum; in <i>Chlamys</i> it is sinuate, and
in <i>Elater</i> it has a deep cavity above the axis which receives
the points of the <i>phragma</i> mentioned before<a name="FNanchor_1802_1802" id="FNanchor_1802_1802"></a><a href="#Footnote_1802_1802" class="fnanchor">[1802]</a>.
The <i>apex</i> of elytra is usually acute, the angle being
formed by the confluence of a curving and straight line:
but there are many exceptions; for instance, in <i>Mylabris</i>
it is rounded; in <i>Hister</i> obliquely, and in <i>Necrophorus</i>
transversely, truncated; in many Capricorns it is emarginate;
in others, as <i>Macropus longimanus</i>, it is bidentate;
in some <i>Prioni</i>, <i>P. cinnamomeus</i>, &amp;c., it terminates
in a mucro at the internal angle; and in <i>Cerambyx
Batus</i>, <i>horridus</i>, &amp;c., at the <i>external</i>; and, to name
no more, in some species of <i>Necydalis</i> it ends in a long
acumen. The <i>scutellar angle</i> in insects that have a large
scutellum, as <i>Macruspis</i> MacLeay, is obliquely truncated
to admit it, but where it is small it is generally rectangular,
with the angle rounded; in <i>Buprestis vittata</i> it
is obtusangular; and in <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>, &amp;c., it is
emarginate. In <i>Cassida spinifex</i>, <i>perforata</i>, &amp;c., the <i>humeral</i>
angle is producted into an acute lobe that stretches
beyond the head, and in <i>C. bicornis</i> and <i>Taurus</i> it forms
a horn at right angles with the elytrum. In general it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
is either rectangular or rounded, with a prominence of
the elytrum within it. The <i>sutural</i> and <i>anal angles</i> exist
only where the elytra are truncated at the apex. In this
case the <i>sutural</i> is generally rectangular, and the <i>anal</i>
rather obtusangular or rounded. The <i>Hypoderma</i> is the
fine soft membrane before noticed<a name="FNanchor_1803_1803" id="FNanchor_1803_1803"></a><a href="#Footnote_1803_1803" class="fnanchor">[1803]</a> that lines the underside
of the elytra, the use of which is probably to prevent
injury to the wings from friction with their usually hard
substance; this membrane is commonly of either a
pallid or brownish colour; but in some insects, as <i>Staphylinus
hybridus</i>, <i>murinus</i>, &amp;c., <i>Buprestis grandis</i>, it is of
a beautiful green or blue; and it exhibits the <i>puncta</i>,
<i>striÃ¦</i>, and other modes of sculpture of the elytra very
distinctly, the pores of which usually perforate this membrane<a name="FNanchor_1804_1804" id="FNanchor_1804_1804"></a><a href="#Footnote_1804_1804" class="fnanchor">[1804]</a>.
Just under the shoulders of these organs you
may observe an oblong and sometimes roundish spot,
occasioned by the <i>hypoderma</i> in that part being particularly
tense, and covering a cavity or pocket which appears
to be connected with the axis by the hollow part,
which I regard as representing the Costal Area; this
pocket is evidently the analogue of a part in the <i>wings</i>
noticed by M. Chabrier<a name="FNanchor_1805_1805" id="FNanchor_1805_1805"></a><a href="#Footnote_1805_1805" class="fnanchor">[1805]</a>, and named by me the <i>phialum</i>:
from its connexion with the axis by a channel,
this part in elytra should also seem destined to receive a
fluid to add to the weight of the margin and its means of
resistance.</p>

<p>5. <i>Shape.</i> The shape of elytra is various; taken together,
in which case, in describing insects, they are denominated
<i>coleoptra</i>, their most common form is more
or less oblong, or forming more or less a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
portion of an ellipse; taken separately, it inclines to that
of an isosceles triangle, with the exterior side curvilinear:
truncated elytra are generally quadrangular, sometimes
presenting a trapezium, at others nearly a parallelogram,
and at others a square. With regard to their
proportions they vary considerably, but the most general
law seems to be that the length shall exceed <i>twice</i> the
width; in some, as <i>Buprestis grandis</i>, it is more than
<i>thrice</i>; in many <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i> they are as wide as they
are long and sometimes wider; they are generally narrower
at the apex than at the base, but in some species
of <i>Lycus</i>, as <i>L. fasciatus</i>, &amp;c., the reverse takes place; in
<i>Telephorus</i> they are nearly of the same width every
where: with regard to their surface they are sometimes
very convex, as in <i>Moluris</i>; at others very flat, as in
<i>Eurychora</i>, <i>Akis</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. <i>Appendages.</i> These, though not so remarkable as
those of the head and prothorax of beetles, ought not
to be overlooked. In many Capricorns, as <i>Lamia Tribulus</i>,
<i>speculifera</i>, &amp;c., the disk and sides are armed with
short sharp spines; in others (<i>Stenocorus</i>, &amp;c.) the sutural
and anal angles or one of them terminate in a spine
or tooth; sometimes the whole surface, as in <i>Hispa atra</i>,
&amp;c., is covered, like a porcupine, with a host of slender
spines, or its sides defended by spinose lobes, as in <i>H. erinacea</i>:
the humeral prominence is armed with a spine
pointing to the head in <i>Macropus longimanus</i>, and forming
a right angle with the elytrum in some <i>CurculionidÃ¦</i>,
as <i>Rhynchites spinifex</i>; but the most remarkable appendage
of this kind is exhibited by <i>Cassida bidens</i> and
its affinities,&mdash;from the centre of the sutures of the elytrum
rise perpendicularly a pair of long, slender, sharp processes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
internally concave, which both apply exactly to
each other, so as together to form a single horn which
rises, like a mast from a ship, from the body of the animal<a name="FNanchor_1806_1806" id="FNanchor_1806_1806"></a><a href="#Footnote_1806_1806" class="fnanchor">[1806]</a>.
Besides the appendages here mentioned, the
elytra exhibit a variety of tubercles and other elevations
of various form and size, which it would be endless to
particularize.</p>

<p>7. <i>Sculpture.</i> The <i>sculpture</i> of the organs in question
is very various and often very ornamental: but as almost
every kind of it will be noticed in the <i>orismological</i>
tables, it will not be necessary to enlarge upon it
here, especially since I have endeavoured upon a former
occasion to explain how it may be useful and important
as well as ornamental to the animal<a name="FNanchor_1807_1807" id="FNanchor_1807_1807"></a><a href="#Footnote_1807_1807" class="fnanchor">[1807]</a>. I shall therefore
only notice a few instances, amongst many, in which
a particular kind of sculpture distinguishes particular
tribes. Amongst those that are Predaceous the <i>CicindelidÃ¦</i>
have elytra without striÃ¦ or furrows, while the
majority of the subsequent terrestrial tribes of this section
are distinguished by them: the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i> in the
Lamellicorn section are remarkable for a single crenated
furrow next the suture; in the weevil tribes the
numerous species of the genus <i>Apion</i> are ornamented by
furrowed elytra with pores in the furrows, which give
them the appearance of neat stitching; in many of those
beetles that have soft elytra, as the glow-worms (<i>Lampyris</i>),
the blister-beetles (<i>Cantharis</i>, <i>Mylabris</i>), and still
more in <i>&#338;demera</i>, two or three slight ridges generally
run longitudinally from the base to the apex, and are
visible also on the under-side; as the <i>furrows</i> probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
lighten a <i>hard</i> elytrum, these ridges may serve to
strengthen a <i>soft</i> one, and it is by these that the first approach
is made to the reticular structure of <i>tegmina</i> or
the wing-covers of <i>Orthoptera</i>: <i>Lycus palliatus</i>, &amp;c., in
its elytra exhibits a direct resemblance of the reticulations
of nervures.</p>

<p>8. <i>Clothing.</i> To what I have before said on this
subject in general<a name="FNanchor_1808_1808" id="FNanchor_1808_1808"></a><a href="#Footnote_1808_1808" class="fnanchor">[1808]</a> I shall here add a few remarks,
which, though they more properly belong to <i>elytra</i>, may
in many cases be extended to the whole body of a beetle.
In various instances it happens that the beautiful markings
of these organs, as in <i>Macropus longimanus</i>, whose
elytra when denuded are black, are produced by short decumbent
hairs; in some these variegations are the effect
of scales resembling those of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, often of a
metallic lustre; from these scales is derived all the brilliancy
of the diamond-beetle (<i>Entimus imperialis</i>, Germ.);
in some the scales are so minute as to resemble the
pollen of flowers, as the white marks observable on the
green elytra of the rose-chafer (<i>Cetonia aurata</i>).</p>

<p>9. <i>Colour.</i> The organs of flight in the majority of
the Orders with respect to <i>colour</i> are usually the most
gaily decorated part of insects; I therefore deferred the
notice of that subject till I came to treat of them. In
general the colour of insects is either inherent in the
substance of their crust, or produced by the hairs or scales
that either partially or totally cover it. To confine myself
to the <i>Coleoptera</i>, of whose elytra we are treating, it
may be observed, I think, in general, that the majority of
those that feed upon <i>putrescent</i> substances, the <i>saprophagous</i>
tribes of Mr. W. S. MacLeay, are commonly of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
more dark and dismal aspect and colour than those which
feed upon such as are living and fresh, denominated <i>thalerophagous</i>
by the same learned author; this you may see
exemplified in his <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> and <i>CetoniadÃ¦</i>. Again, in
the Predaceous beetles a similar contrast of colours is often
observable. How brilliant and gay are the fierce <i>CicindelÃ¦</i>!
those tigers of insects, as LinnÃ© calls them; how black
as to colour, how horrible in aspect is their near relation
the <i>Manticora</i>: what difference exists in the economy of
these animals is not known, except, as I learn from Mr.
Burchell, that the latter is subterraneous, whereas the
former seek the sunbeam and fly rapidly. I shall now
point out a few instances in which the colours of their
<i>elytra</i> distinguish tribes or families. Amongst the Predaceous
beetles a large family of the <i>CicindelidÃ¦</i> are
distinguished by a middle angular white band, and several
white dots on their green or brown elytra, as in
<i>C. sylvatica</i>; a family of <i>Brachinus</i>, and the majority
of <i>Mylabris</i>, <i>Lamia capensis</i> and <i>fasciatus</i>, &amp;c., by
black elytra, with yellow or red bands; <i>Carabus violacea</i>
and affinities by the violet margin of these organs; <i>Calliochroma</i>
Latreille by their <i>sericeous</i>, and <i>Eumolpus</i> by
their <i>metallic</i>, lustre. These instances will be sufficient
to turn your attention to this subject, which though not
of <i>primary</i> importance in discriminating genera &amp;c., is
not without its use in a <i>secondary</i> view.</p>

<p>10. <i>Uses.</i> I must not quit this subject without saying
something upon the ends which elytra seem designed to
serve. Their first and most obvious use is the protection
of the wings when unemployed, that they may not be
lacerated or soiled, and rendered unfit for flight in the
various retreats to which these animals betake themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
either for food, repose, or to lay their eggs; to promote
this purpose more effectually, the wings are usually curiously
folded and laid up under them; and where the
elytra are very short, as in the <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, these folds
are very numerous and complex. In some instances,
however, as in <i>Molorchus</i> F., <i>Atractocerus</i>, &amp;c., the wings
are only partially protected by the elytra and not folded
under them; probably they are less in danger of laceration
from their peculiar habits than the generality. Another
use is to protect the upper-side of the alitrunk, which for
reasons before assigned is usually softer than the under-side,
and also of the abdomen, often above nearly membranous,
from the injury to which they would otherwise
be exposed; in the latter part also the spiracles in <i>Coleoptera</i>
are not covered by the inosculations of the segments,
as is the case in most other Orders, and therefore
probably require some covering when the insect is not
flying. In the Apterous beetles this appears to be their
principal use; where these organs are connate, or as it
were soldered together, the back of the abdomen is a
thin membrane; the appearance of <i>two</i> elytra in these
cases is given, doubtless, for the sake of symmetry and
beauty, a subordinate attention to which may be traced
in all the works of creation. If we consider the bulk and
weight of many flying beetles, we may imagine that they
want some assistance, more than the extent and dimension
of their wings seem to promise, to support them in
the air, and to enable them to move more readily in it;
and although it seems clear from the state of their muscular
apparatus that elytra do not move much in flight,
yet by giving a broad and concave surface to the air, for
then they are usually nearly vertical, they may assist in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
some measure as sails, and help them in flying traversely
and before the wind<a name="FNanchor_1809_1809" id="FNanchor_1809_1809"></a><a href="#Footnote_1809_1809" class="fnanchor">[1809]</a>.</p>


<p>ii. <i>Tegmina</i><a name="FNanchor_1810_1810" id="FNanchor_1810_1810"></a><a href="#Footnote_1810_1810" class="fnanchor">[1810]</a>. By this name the learned Illiger has
distinguished the upper organs of flight of the <i>Orthoptera</i>
and Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1811_1811" id="FNanchor_1811_1811"></a><a href="#Footnote_1811_1811" class="fnanchor">[1811]</a>. They may be
considered under the same heads nearly as elytra.</p>

<p>1. <i>Substance.</i> <i>Tegmina</i> differ very materially from
<i>elytra</i> in their <i>substance</i>, being generally more or less
diaphanous, though in <i>Blatta Petiveriana</i> the dark parts
are as opaque as elytra, and those of the <i>Mantes</i> that
resemble dry leaves are only semidiaphanous. These
organs are also of a less dense substance than elytra,
something between coriaceous and membranous, which I
shall express by the term <i>pergameneous</i>, as somewhat resembling
parchment or vellum. Another circumstance
relative to this head also distinguishes them,&mdash;they are not
lined with membrane. In some instances, as in <i>B. Petiveriana</i>
just named, they approach nearly to the substance
of elytra, and in <i>B. viridis</i>, some <i>Mantes</i>, and <i>Tettigonia</i>,
&amp;c., they are little different from wings in their substance;
but this does not diminish their right to be considered
as <i>tegmina</i>, since their structure is altogether the same.</p>

<p>2. <i>Articulation with the trunk.</i> I observed above that
the axis of elytra may be regarded as formed of <i>three</i>
parts, one appertaining to each of the areas or their representatives<a name="FNanchor_1812_1812" id="FNanchor_1812_1812"></a><a href="#Footnote_1812_1812" class="fnanchor">[1812]</a>;
in <i>tegmina</i>, and indeed in wings in general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
these parts are separate and may be more distinctly
traced, the <i>axis</i> of the <i>Costal</i> Area being generally the
longest, and that of the <i>Intermediate</i> often the shortest;
these <i>axes</i> are suspended in the wing-socket by elastic
ligaments, intermixed with hard bony plates, the
principal one of which, called by M. Chabrier the <i>humerus</i><a name="FNanchor_1813_1813" id="FNanchor_1813_1813"></a><a href="#Footnote_1813_1813" class="fnanchor">[1813]</a>,
is connected both with the <i>tegmen</i> and the
trunk, and in some a little resembles the head and neck
of a swan. This structure permits the animal to move
the lateral areas in some degree separately, so that each,
especially the <i>anal</i>, shall form an angle with the intermediate;
as the motion of the latter is not wanted, its
<i>axis</i> often falls short of the base, or is obsolete, as in
<i>Blatta</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Composition.</i> The three areas, traces of which we
had discovered in <i>elytra</i>, are particularly visible in <i>tegmina</i>.
If you take any cockroach (<i>Blatta</i>), you will at
first sight see that in it they are divided into three larger
portions by stronger nervures or folds; and if you also
take a <i>Mantis</i>, or <i>Locusta</i> Leach, a <i>Fulgora</i> or <i>Tettigonia</i>,
the same circumstance will strike you, only you will
see that in these the intermediate portion terminates also
in an axis; these are what I call the three <i>areas</i>. The
external one or Costal is usually the longest and narrowest<a name="FNanchor_1814_1814" id="FNanchor_1814_1814"></a><a href="#Footnote_1814_1814" class="fnanchor">[1814]</a>;
the Intermediate one is commonly triangular,
with its inner side curvilinear<a name="FNanchor_1815_1815" id="FNanchor_1815_1815"></a><a href="#Footnote_1815_1815" class="fnanchor">[1815]</a>; and the interior
one, or <i>Anal</i> area, in the <i>Orthoptera</i> is rather oblong;
in <i>Fulgora</i> angular, and in <i>Tettigonia</i> it presents an
isosceles triangle; with its vertex to the apex of the
wing<a name="FNanchor_1816_1816" id="FNanchor_1816_1816"></a><a href="#Footnote_1816_1816" class="fnanchor">[1816]</a>. The first of these may be defined as that portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
of the wing that lies between the <i>costal</i> and <i>postcostal</i>
nervures; and perhaps, in some cases, as in <i>Mantis</i>,
for there is the fold of the <i>tegmen</i>, the <i>mediastinal</i> may
be regarded as its limit; the Intermediate Area is that
which lies between the <i>postcostal</i> or <i>mediastinal</i> nervure
and the <i>anal</i> fold of the wing; and the Anal Area is the
remainder. These areas may perhaps best be made out
by tracing each to its axis. To study them carefully in
<i>tegmina</i> and <i>hemelytra</i> is of considerable importance;
for in them we find the first outline of the general plan
upon which the wings of insects are constructed, and
which, as we shall see hereafter, more or less enters into
the composition of them all.</p>

<p>4. <i>Position, and folding in repose.</i> With regard to
their position when not expanded, <i>tegmina</i> vary somewhat
in the different tribes. In the <i>Coleoptera</i> we have
seen that, except in a few instances, the elytra unite at
their suture. Something like this takes place in <i>Fulgora</i>,
<i>Cercopis</i> and affinities, in the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>;
in these, though the union is not near so exact, yet the
<i>tegmina</i> do not lap over each other; they are usually
more or less deflexed, with scarcely any portion in a horizontal
position: in <i>Tettigonia</i> F., <i>Chermes</i>, <i>Aphis</i>, &amp;c.,
the middle part only of these organs meets, from which
point they diverge both towards their base and apex<a name="FNanchor_1817_1817" id="FNanchor_1817_1817"></a><a href="#Footnote_1817_1817" class="fnanchor">[1817]</a>.
In the <i>Orthoptera</i> the position is quite different, for one
tegmen more or less lies over the other. In <i>Blatta</i>, in
which the <i>tegmina</i> are nearly horizontal, the left hand
one covers almost half the other<a name="FNanchor_1818_1818" id="FNanchor_1818_1818"></a><a href="#Footnote_1818_1818" class="fnanchor">[1818]</a>: in the other tribes of
the Order, with little variation, the Anal Area of the <i>tegmen</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
is horizontal, and covers the back of the animal, and
the Intermediate and Costal are vertical and cover its
sides; the former, however, in some cases, only forms the
angle between them. Sometimes in these the right-hand
one is laid upon the left, as in <i>Acheta</i>; and sometimes the
reverse of this takes place, as in <i>Acrida</i> K. With regard
to the folding of the <i>tegmina</i>, the most remarkable instance
that occurs is that of <i>Acheta monstrosa</i>, in which the ends
of both these organs and the wings, in repose, are folded
like a fan, and then rolled up like a serpent<a name="FNanchor_1819_1819" id="FNanchor_1819_1819"></a><a href="#Footnote_1819_1819" class="fnanchor">[1819]</a>.</p>

<p>5. <i>Shape.</i> The shape of <i>tegmina</i> is various. In the
<i>BlattÃ¦</i> and some <i>Mantes</i> they are more or less <i>oblong</i>;
in <i>Mantis precaria</i>, <i>strumaria</i><a name="FNanchor_1820_1820" id="FNanchor_1820_1820"></a><a href="#Footnote_1820_1820" class="fnanchor">[1820]</a>, and others, they incline
to <i>elliptical</i>; in <i>Phasma grandis</i> and <i>Acheta monstrosa</i> they
are rather <i>panduriform</i><a name="FNanchor_1821_1821" id="FNanchor_1821_1821"></a><a href="#Footnote_1821_1821" class="fnanchor">[1821]</a>; in <i>M. gongyloides</i> they are
<i>semi-cordate</i><a name="FNanchor_1822_1822" id="FNanchor_1822_1822"></a><a href="#Footnote_1822_1822" class="fnanchor">[1822]</a>; in <i>Pterophylla trapeziformis</i> they are
<i>rhomboidal</i><a name="FNanchor_1823_1823" id="FNanchor_1823_1823"></a><a href="#Footnote_1823_1823" class="fnanchor">[1823]</a>; in <i>Conocephalus erosus</i> they are <i>sinuated</i>;
in <i>Locusta</i> Leach they are usually <i>linear</i> or linear-oblong<a name="FNanchor_1824_1824" id="FNanchor_1824_1824"></a><a href="#Footnote_1824_1824" class="fnanchor">[1824]</a>;
in <i>Pterophylla</i> K. they generally terminate in a
short mucro<a name="FNanchor_1825_1825" id="FNanchor_1825_1825"></a><a href="#Footnote_1825_1825" class="fnanchor">[1825]</a>; and in some of those <i>MantidÃ¦</i> whose
<i>tegmina</i> simulate arid leaves, in a recurved one<a name="FNanchor_1826_1826" id="FNanchor_1826_1826"></a><a href="#Footnote_1826_1826" class="fnanchor">[1826]</a>. In
the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i> the shape of these organs
is less various. In the <i>FulgorellÃ¦</i> Latr. they incline to
a trapezium, sometimes to a pentagon<a name="FNanchor_1827_1827" id="FNanchor_1827_1827"></a><a href="#Footnote_1827_1827" class="fnanchor">[1827]</a>; in the <i>TettigoniÃ¦</i>
F. they approach to an obtuse-angled triangle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>
and in others of the tribe they are nearly wedge-shaped<a name="FNanchor_1828_1828" id="FNanchor_1828_1828"></a><a href="#Footnote_1828_1828" class="fnanchor">[1828]</a>.</p>

<p>6. <i>Neuration.</i> The circumstance that most strikingly
distinguishes <i>tegmina</i> from <i>elytra</i> is their <i>neuration</i> or
veining; which adds much to their strength, without increasing
their weight so much as to render them unapt
for flight. To look at these organs in <i>Blatta Petiveriana</i>,
you would imagine them at first to be deprived of this
distinction; but if you observe them attentively, particularly
their white spots, you will soon detect their nervures;
and if you further examine their lower surface,
you will find them very visible. The gibbous <i>BlattÃ¦</i>
also, <i>Blatta picta</i> and affinities, the analogues of <i>Erotylus</i>
amongst the <i>Coleoptera</i>, have <i>tegmina</i> which, except at
their apex, exhibit but faint traces of the nervures of their
tribe, and approach to elytra besides by the innumerable
minute impressed points that cover them. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>
and some Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i> the nervures may
be divided into <i>longitudinal</i> ones more or less ramified,
and <i>traversing</i> ones. In the <i>BlattÃ¦</i> the traversing nervures
cut the longitudinal ones nearly at right angles, but
not at regular intervals, so as to cover the tegmen with
quadrangular areolets; in <i>Mantis precaria</i> and affinities
the longitudinal nervures of the Anal Area diverge from
the base, and are traversed nearly as in <i>Blatta</i>, while
those of the Costal diverge from the mediastinal nervure,
but the traversing ones form innumerable irregular reticulations;
in <i>Mantis sinuata</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_1829_1829" id="FNanchor_1829_1829"></a><a href="#Footnote_1829_1829" class="fnanchor">[1829]</a> the whole tegmen has
such reticulations but less numerous; in <i>Locusta</i> Leach
it is regularly reticulated at the base, but the areolets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
the apex are quadrangular; in the <i>Mantes</i>, with oblong
wings, all are quadrangular; in <i>Pterophylla</i> K. the
longitudinal diverging nervures are not numerous, and
the traversing ones cut them into quadrangular and triangular
areolets, besides which they are covered by innumerable
impressed points, so as altogether to exhibit
a most exact resemblance of the leaf of some evergreen:
in <i>Gryllotalpa</i> the longitudinal nervures of the Anal Area
rather converge towards the apex, are traversed by few
transverse nervures, and those of the Costal Area which
diverge from the mediastinal nervure by still fewer; the
neuration of <i>Acheta</i> F. has been before described<a name="FNanchor_1830_1830" id="FNanchor_1830_1830"></a><a href="#Footnote_1830_1830" class="fnanchor">[1830]</a>; I
shall only observe here, that the constructors of <i>stringed</i>
instruments of music might, perhaps, from the <i>tegmina</i>
of the male, the nervures of which probably modulate
the sounds which it produces, take a hint for giving the
strings in them a serpentine or convolute direction, and
so might produce something new in that department,
corresponding with the serpents and French-horns in
<i>wind</i> instruments. Of the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i> in
the <i>FulgorellÃ¦</i> Latr., which are most analogous to the
<i>Orthoptera</i> of all that tribe, the longitudinal nervures are
more numerous and branching, more especially toward
the apex of the <i>tegmen</i>, and are traversed as much by
transverse ones, sometimes reticulating the wing with
roundish areolets, as in <i>F. laternaria</i>, and at others with
quadrangular ones, as in <i>F. candelaria</i>; in some of these
however, as <i>Otiocerus</i> K., <i>Flata</i> F., &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1831_1831" id="FNanchor_1831_1831"></a><a href="#Footnote_1831_1831" class="fnanchor">[1831]</a>, there are no
traversing nervures; and these lead to the <i>CercopidÃ¦</i>
and others in which the longitudinal nervures become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
few, and some are without any<a name="FNanchor_1832_1832" id="FNanchor_1832_1832"></a><a href="#Footnote_1832_1832" class="fnanchor">[1832]</a>, and these terminate
those of this section of the Order in which the nervures
in question are continued to the margin of the wing. We
next come to those, <i>Darnis</i>, <i>Centrotus</i>, <i>Membracis</i>, &amp;c.,
in which they are circumscribed a little within the apex by
a traversing nervure, so that the tegmen ends in a margin
of pure membrane, and thus some approach seems to be
made to the <i>Hemelytra</i>, from <i>Tettigonia</i>, the most conspicuous
genus of this tribe, in which the <i>areolets</i>, few in
number, like those of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, are not formed, except
the terminal ones, by traversing nervures, but by the
ramifications of the longitudinal ones; in <i>Chermes</i> the Intermediate
Area, which is connected with the base of the
wing by a single nervure, is the only part that has any
areolets<a name="FNanchor_1833_1833" id="FNanchor_1833_1833"></a><a href="#Footnote_1833_1833" class="fnanchor">[1833]</a>.</p>

<p>7. <i>Colour.</i> Orthopterous insects are seldom remarkable
for <i>tegmina</i> of brilliant <i>colours</i>; there is in them none
of that gilding or metallic lustre which so often distinguishes
elytra: they are also frequently less ornamented in
this respect than the wings, with which they usually form
an agreeable contrast. Their reticulations and nervures,
which are sometimes of a different colour from the rest
of the tegmen, decorate them considerably: a remarkable
circumstance belonging to this head attends the black
tegmina of <i>Blatta Petiveriana</i>; one has <i>four</i> white spots,
and the other only <i>three</i>; but as one laps over the other,
the symmetry of the arrangement is preserved: the Homopterous
<i>Hemiptera</i> are more distinguished in this respect,
and some of the <i>FulgoridÃ¦</i> imitate the <i>Lepidoptera</i>
both by their ocelli and spots: <i>Fulgora laternaria</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>
<i>Candelaria</i>, <i>serrata</i>, and <i>Diadema</i>, sufficiently exemplify this
remark, as do several <i>FlatÃ¦</i> likewise<a name="FNanchor_1834_1834" id="FNanchor_1834_1834"></a><a href="#Footnote_1834_1834" class="fnanchor">[1834]</a>.</p>

<p>We may observe here&mdash;that <i>tegmina</i> are more calculated
for flight than <i>elytra</i>, both from their thinner substance,
and from the angle that their Anal Area, and often
the Costal, forms with the rest of the <i>tegmen</i>; a circumstance
which, in wings, M. Chabrier thinks presents some
facilities in that kind of motion.</p>


<p>iii. <i>Hemelytra</i><a name="FNanchor_1835_1835" id="FNanchor_1835_1835"></a><a href="#Footnote_1835_1835" class="fnanchor">[1835]</a>. The next species of wing-covers,
which though varying in the substance of their base, terminate
in a part distinct from the three areas, consisting
in almost every case of mere membrane, peculiar to the
Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, are called <i>hemelytra</i>, or half-elytra:&mdash;this
term was also formerly employed, but certainly
incorrectly, to denote <i>tegmina</i>. I shall consider
them with respect to such of the particulars noticed under
the former heads as apply to them, but without repeating
them formally.</p>

<p>1. As to their <i>substance</i>, they must be separately considered
with regard to their base and apex. In various instances
the <i>base</i>, or part consisting of the three areas, is almost
corneous, as in <i>Cydnus Morio</i> and <i>bicolor</i>, bugs not uncommon
with us, and many others<a name="FNanchor_1836_1836" id="FNanchor_1836_1836"></a><a href="#Footnote_1836_1836" class="fnanchor">[1836]</a>; in these cases it is lined
with a <i>hypoderma</i> like elytra; and in many the points,
which are impressed upon it, also perforate the <i>hemelytrum</i>,
and seem to act as pores: but in <i>LygÃ¦us</i>, <i>Reduvius</i>,
<i>Capsus</i>, <i>Miris</i>, and the majority of the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>,
the organs in question being soft and flexible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
may be stated as rather resembling leather than horn;&mdash;on
this account this part of a <i>hemelytrum</i> is denominated the
<i>corium</i>. In <i>Scutellera</i> the portion covered by the scutellum
is membranous; and in <i>Acanthia paradoxa</i>, and
the cucullated species of <i>Tingis</i>, the wing-covers are entirely
so. The apex of these organs is almost universally
either membranous or coriaceo-membranous, on which
account it is called the <i>membrana</i>. I say <i>almost</i>, because
in <i>Aradus</i> and the <i>HydrocorisÃ¦</i> Latr., this part, though
rather thinner than the rest of the <i>Hemelytrum</i>, is also
coriaceous; in the latter tribe usually with a very narrow
membranous edge; and in many <i>Reduvii</i> and <i>Zeli</i> there
is scarcely any difference in the substance of the base and
apex.</p>

<p>2. As to the <i>articulation</i> of <i>Hemelytra</i> with the trunk, it
seems not strikingly different from that of <i>tegmina</i>: the
point or base of the Intermediate Area, which falls short
of that of the lateral areas, seems connected by a slender
ligamentous piece, with its axis, which is thick; and I do
not discern Chabrier's <i>humerus</i> shaped like a swan's head
and neck<a name="FNanchor_1837_1837" id="FNanchor_1837_1837"></a><a href="#Footnote_1837_1837" class="fnanchor">[1837]</a>.</p>

<p>3. The <i>composition</i> of these organs differs from that of
<i>tegmina</i> in more respects than one: in the first place, they
consist, as was lately observed, of <i>four</i> instead of <i>three</i>
areas; in the next, they appear to have, at least several
of them, a part, which I suspect to be analogous to that
above described in <i>Coleoptera</i>, supposed to represent the
<i>phialum</i> of wings<a name="FNanchor_1838_1838" id="FNanchor_1838_1838"></a><a href="#Footnote_1838_1838" class="fnanchor">[1838]</a>. I shall first speak of the <i>areas</i>. In
some apterous species related to the bed-bug, <i>LygÃ¦us
brevicollis</i> Latr.<a name="FNanchor_1839_1839" id="FNanchor_1839_1839"></a><a href="#Footnote_1839_1839" class="fnanchor">[1839]</a>, &amp;c., there is no trace of the usual areas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
and the <i>membrana</i> is a very narrow strip; in <i>L. apterus</i>
the former are very faintly traced out, but they are present
in all those that are furnished with wings; whence
we may conjecture that they are of the same importance
in flight with the folds observable in those organs<a name="FNanchor_1840_1840" id="FNanchor_1840_1840"></a><a href="#Footnote_1840_1840" class="fnanchor">[1840]</a>. The
three basal areas may be said most commonly to present
three isosceles triangles, the Costal one being narrow and
curvilinear<a name="FNanchor_1841_1841" id="FNanchor_1841_1841"></a><a href="#Footnote_1841_1841" class="fnanchor">[1841]</a>, the Intermediate the most ample<a name="FNanchor_1842_1842" id="FNanchor_1842_1842"></a><a href="#Footnote_1842_1842" class="fnanchor">[1842]</a>, and the
Anal one the narrowest and shortest<a name="FNanchor_1843_1843" id="FNanchor_1843_1843"></a><a href="#Footnote_1843_1843" class="fnanchor">[1843]</a>, with its vertex towards
the apex of the <i>Hemelytrum</i>, while in the two former
it is at its base. In <i>LygÃ¦us compressipes</i> (<i>Rhinuchus</i>
K. MS.) the Anal Area is cultriform; and in most of the
<i>HydrocorisÃ¦</i> it has an angle in the middle of its posterior
margin. The proportion that the <i>membrana</i> or <i>apical area</i>
bears to the rest of the wing varies in the different tribes.
In some, as before stated, it is obsolete, in others nearly
so; in the majority, perhaps, it occupies about a <i>third</i> of
the <i>hemelytrum</i>; in <i>LygÃ¦us compressipes</i>, <i>cruciatus</i>, &amp;c.,
full <i>half</i>; in <i>Alydus calcaratus</i>, <i>two-thirds</i>; in <i>Reduvius</i>,
nearly <i>three-quarters</i><a name="FNanchor_1844_1844" id="FNanchor_1844_1844"></a><a href="#Footnote_1844_1844" class="fnanchor">[1844]</a>; and in <i>Aradus depressus</i> the corium,&mdash;divided,
however, though indistinctly, into the three
areas,&mdash;is driven to the <i>base</i> of the wing: two ends are
answered by this structure&mdash;as this insect lives under
bark, its thin <i>hemelytra</i> take less room; and as it flies,
though it has only rudiments of wings, they are more fit
to supply their place: the part we are speaking of usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
runs obliquely from the vertex of the Anal Area to the
base of the Costal.</p>

<p>4. As to their <i>position and folding in repose</i>, <i>Hemelytra</i> are
usually nearly or altogether <i>horizontal</i>; but in <i>Notonecta</i>
and <i>Plea</i> they are <i>deflexed</i> and cover the sides of the body;
and the apical area of one wing precisely covers that of
the other; where the scutellum does not intervene, as in
<i>Scutellera</i>, <i>Pentatoma</i>, &amp;c., the vertical angles of the Anal
Area meet in the middle of the back, so as to exhibit
the appearance of a cross. In <i>Notonecta</i>, in which the
<i>hemelytra</i> are deflexed, at the apex of the <i>membrana</i> is
a fissure which permits the two sides to form an angle
with each other, and to apply exactly to the body. In
<i>Plea</i>, in which there is no apical area, the posterior
margins of the <i>tegmina</i>, as they ought rather to be termed,
unite, but do not lap over each other. With regard
to the appearance of something like a <i>phialum</i>, if you examine
the <i>hemelytra</i> of most species of bugs on the underside,
you will see that the costal nervure at the base
is inflexed and covers a kind of channel; if you next take
one of <i>Belostoma grandis</i>, where the structure is most conspicuous,
or even the common <i>Nepa cinerea</i>, you will find
in the same situation, adjacent to the inflexed costal nervure,
a hollow tube running from the base of the wing,
and terminating, after proceeding about one-fourth of its
length, in a hollow cavity, which, as it is covered by a
membrane, appears to me to be a collapsed pouch. This
circumstance is worthy of further and more general investigation.</p>

<p>5. In their <i>shape</i>, with few exceptions, <i>hemelytra</i> more or
less represent a wedge, being wider at their apex, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>
they are usually obliquely truncated, than at the base;
but in <i>Plea</i> Leach they are obtusangular, with the angle
in the sutural margin; in <i>Notonecta</i>, on the contrary, an
obtusangular sinus distinguishes that part; in <i>Naucoris</i>
they are curvilinear and every where of equal width; in
<i>Ranatra</i> they are linear and straight; in <i>Aradus</i> they
are oblong, usually with an external lobe or dilatation at
their base: a remarkable instance of the intention of this
is observable in a nondescript Brazilian species, in which
the head, prothorax, and abdomen, are edged with a
number of broad foliaceous appendages; if the base of
the <i>hemelytrum</i> had not been furnished with a similar
appendage, the symmetry of the whole body would have
been destroyed by the hiatus between the prothorax and
abdomen, as may be seen by removing the <i>hemelytra</i>; but
by this compensating contrivance of Providence, the gap
is filled, the above lobe fitting exactly into it.</p>

<p>6. The <i>neuration</i> of these organs will not occupy us long,
since the <i>corium</i> or harder part, though in some species
there are traces of nervures, is often without them. Those
of the cucullated species of <i>Tingis</i> resemble many <i>tegmina</i>
in being ornamented by them with a kind of network,
which looks like the finest lace; in several <i>LygÃ¦i</i>, <i>Edessa</i>,
and some <i>Reduvii</i>, there are a few diverging longitudinal
nervures which occasionally by a ramification here and
there form an areolet<a name="FNanchor_1845_1845" id="FNanchor_1845_1845"></a><a href="#Footnote_1845_1845" class="fnanchor">[1845]</a>, but there are seldom any traversing
nervures. The Apical Area is usually most distinguished
by nervures, in some forming several areolets,
as in <i>Aradus</i>, in others running parallel to each other,
nearly to the end of this area, as in <i>Belostoma grandis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
where they are met by a traversing nervure; the object
of this is doubtless to strengthen the membrane.</p>

<p>7. Both <i>tegmina</i> and <i>hemelytra</i> are most commonly
naked, yet very short <i>hairs</i> are found on those of some
species of <i>Cercopis</i>, and in many more instances in those
of the latter description, as in <i>Notonecta</i>, several <i>LygÃ¦i</i>
and <i>Reduvii</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>8. <i>Colours</i> in <i>hemelytra</i> are very various, and in many
instances are peculiar to families; in certain <i>LygÃ¦i</i> (<i>L.
Hyoscyami</i>, &amp;c.) black and red; in <i>LygÃ¦us compressipes</i>
and affinities a dingy black; in some <i>Reduvii</i> black with
a large white spot;&mdash;but it is needless to enlarge further
on this subject.</p>

<p>9. That <i>hemelytra</i> are used in flight is evident not only
from the large space allowed for their muscles<a name="FNanchor_1846_1846" id="FNanchor_1846_1846"></a><a href="#Footnote_1846_1846" class="fnanchor">[1846]</a>, but likewise
from a circumstance noticed by M. Chabrier, that
in flight, in the <i>PentatomÃ¦</i> Latr., the corium of the <i>hemelytrum</i>
is fixed to the wing<a href="#Footnote_1846_1846" class="fnanchor">[1846]</a>; in which case both must
describe the same arc.</p>


<p>iv. <i>Wings.</i> We are next to consider organs which are
exclusively appropriated to <i>flight</i>, and therefore are properly
denominated <i>wings</i>. These in the Orders that have
<i>elytra</i>, <i>tegmina</i>, or <i>hemelytra</i>, are the pair that correspond
with the secondary wings of the other Orders. It may
be said, indeed, that in several instances both <i>tegmina</i> and
<i>hemelytra</i> do not differ at all in substance or use from the
wings that they cover. This is true; but as their structure
in other respects is the same with that of those that
are more solid and less apt for flight, it was convenient to
consider them under the same name.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span></p>
<p>1. To begin with the <i>articulation of these organs with
the trunk</i>; in general it may be stated that this, as in
<i>tegmina</i> and <i>hemelytra</i>, is usually by the intervention of
three axes, formed by the conflux of the nervures of the
three areas at the base of the wing, which either immediately
or by other pieces are implanted in the trunk, so
as to receive from it the aÃ«rial and other fluids, necessary
for its expansion and motions<a name="FNanchor_1847_1847" id="FNanchor_1847_1847"></a><a href="#Footnote_1847_1847" class="fnanchor">[1847]</a>. Having given this
general statement, I shall next apply it to the wings in
some of the different Orders. If you carefully extract one
from the stag-beetle (<i>Lucanus Cervus</i>) or any large species
of the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>, in the <i>Coleoptera</i>; the first thing that
will strike you, upon examining the base, will be the plate
before mentioned called by Chabrier the <i>humerus</i>, which
is a stout transverse corneous piece, with a deep sinus towards
the wing, filled with ligament: if you again follow
the costal, mediastinal, and postcostal nervures, you will
find them unite to form an axis, consisting of three parallel
pieces, which connects by its intermediate internal
piece with one end of this plate. The nervures of the Intermediate
Area terminate also in a corneous axis at a
greater distance from the base than the other two, which
connects with Chabrier's <i>humerus</i> by means of the ligament
of the sinus just named. Those of the Anal Area
are received by a ligament attached to a transverse plate,
widest at its anterior end, which connects with the posterior
part of the said <i>humerus</i>; and at its posterior end is
united to the <i>postfrÃ¦num</i><a name="FNanchor_1848_1848" id="FNanchor_1848_1848"></a><a href="#Footnote_1848_1848" class="fnanchor">[1848]</a>, with which it forms a right
angle. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> Order the structure is not very
different, but the axes and other plates of the base of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
wing are less distinct and rather cartilaginous; the nervures
of the Anal Area often terminate in a transverse one
that there forms the segment of a circle<a name="FNanchor_1849_1849" id="FNanchor_1849_1849"></a><a href="#Footnote_1849_1849" class="fnanchor">[1849]</a>; the inner base
of this circle is ligament connected with the <i>postfrÃ¦num</i><a name="FNanchor_1850_1850" id="FNanchor_1850_1850"></a><a href="#Footnote_1850_1850" class="fnanchor">[1850]</a>.
In the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i> the three axes may be
readily traced, but the <i>humeral</i> plate, with which they all
are connected, is more irregular in shape, and in <i>Fulgora</i>
longitudinal, with an angular surface; in this Order the
nervure, in some cases consisting of cartilaginous rings<a name="FNanchor_1851_1851" id="FNanchor_1851_1851"></a><a href="#Footnote_1851_1851" class="fnanchor">[1851]</a>,
in which the <i>frÃ¦num</i> and <i>postfrÃ¦num</i> terminate in the
<i>tegmina</i> and wings, is attached posteriorly to the ligament
of the Anal Area. In the Heteropterous section the three
axes are evident, but the <i>humeral</i> plate is not easily made
out. In the <i>Libellulina</i> the axes of the Costal and Intermediate
Areas are the coloured broad plates at their base,
formed by the dilatation of their nervures; that, however,
of the Anal is not dilated, but forms one nervure, in the
primary wing, with the <i>frÃ¦num</i>, and in the secondary with
the <i>postfrÃ¦num</i>. Having given you this clue to trace the
axes in those tribes in which they are most conspicuous,
it will assist you in searching for them in the remaining
Orders, in all of which they may be traced, except
perhaps in those minute <i>Hymenoptera</i> whose wings have
solely the costal nervures; probably in these there is only
<i>one</i> axis. In the <i>Lepidoptera</i> and <i>Hymenoptera</i> a circumstance
connected with the present head is observable,
which is not to be discovered in the other Orders: these
are the <i>tegulÃ¦</i> or base-covers, which appear intended to
defend the base of the anterior wings. They are concavo-convex
scales, which in the <i>Lepidoptera</i> are large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>
and of an irregular shape<a name="FNanchor_1852_1852" id="FNanchor_1852_1852"></a><a href="#Footnote_1852_1852" class="fnanchor">[1852]</a>, but in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> are
smaller and semicircular<a name="FNanchor_1853_1853" id="FNanchor_1853_1853"></a><a href="#Footnote_1853_1853" class="fnanchor">[1853]</a>.</p>

<p>2. Wings, with regard to their <i>substance</i>, may generally
be termed <i>membranous</i>; but they vary in this respect, some
being much thicker than others, either <i>partially</i> or <i>totally</i>:
in spotted wings, as in those of many <i>Libellulina</i>,
<i>TettigoniÃ¦</i> F., &amp;c., the dark opaque parts are denser than
those that are transparent: in several <i>Orthopterous</i> insects,
as in <i>Phasma</i>, some <i>Mantes</i>, &amp;c., the Costal Area
or covering part of the wing is of a substance equally
firm with that of the <i>tegmen</i>. This is a compensating
contrivance, that where the latter is shorter and smaller
than the former, its membranous part, when folded, may
be protected from injury. Another similar contrivance
of <span class="smcap">Divine Wisdom</span> is exhibited by those <i>PterophyllÃ¦</i>
K. (<i>Locusta</i> F.) whose <i>tegmina</i> resemble the leaves of
plants (<i>Pt. laurifolia</i>, &amp;c.); in these the tip of the wings
when folded being longer, is not covered by the <i>tegmina</i>,
and therefore exposed to injury; to prevent which this
small piece, while the whole wing, as far as covered by
those organs, is membranous, is of the same substance
with them<a name="FNanchor_1854_1854" id="FNanchor_1854_1854"></a><a href="#Footnote_1854_1854" class="fnanchor">[1854]</a>. The wings of most <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>,
<i>Hemiptera</i>, and <i>Thereva coleoptrata</i>, in the <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c.,
are of a firmer substance than those of the other Orders;
in many <i>LocustÃ¦</i> Leach, <i>FulgorÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., they are nearly as
firm as the <i>tegmina</i>; and in <i>Ascalaphus italicus</i>, except
at their base, the <i>secondary</i> wings are less membranous
than the <i>primary</i>. M. Chabrier has observed<a name="FNanchor_1855_1855" id="FNanchor_1855_1855"></a><a href="#Footnote_1855_1855" class="fnanchor">[1855]</a> that the
wings of insects in general diminish in thickness from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>
base to their apex, and from their anterior to their posterior
margin.</p>

<p>3. I should have had, it is probable, but little original
matter to communicate under the head of the <i>composition</i>
and <i>neuration</i> of wings, had M. Jurine, who has written
so ably on those of <i>Hymenoptera</i>, undertaken a survey of
the organs of flight in every Order of insects: but as his
views were confined to only <i>two</i> of the Linnean Orders,
it is not wonderful that his system and set of terms should
fail where a generalization is necessary; and I may stand
acquitted of presumption and conceit if I attempt to substitute
a system and body of terms more universally applicable.
Had the plan of this able Entomologist led
him to pay attention to <i>tegmina</i> and <i>hemelytra</i>, their
division into three longitudinal areas would have immediately
struck him; and having acquired this outline of
the greater natural divisions, he would have applied it to
the Orders that have <i>wings</i> only, and having discovered
that it is to be traced in all, the result would have probably
superseded my labors. Had his life been longer
spared, perhaps something of this kind would have been
effected by him; but as he, alas! is gone, and no abler
hand seems to have undertaken the task, I will do what
I can to give you satisfaction on this subject<a name="FNanchor_1856_1856" id="FNanchor_1856_1856"></a><a href="#Footnote_1856_1856" class="fnanchor">[1856]</a>. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
have already got a tolerably good idea of these areas from
what has been said upon the subject under <i>tegmina</i> and
<i>hemelytra</i>; but I shall now more particularly state to you
how they are circumstanced in <i>wings</i>. I shall first explain
the general law as to their limits. The <i>Costal
Area</i><a name="FNanchor_1857_1857" id="FNanchor_1857_1857"></a><a href="#Footnote_1857_1857" class="fnanchor">[1857]</a> is all that longitudinal portion of the wing that lies
between the anterior margin and the postcostal nervure;
the <i>Intermediate Area</i><a name="FNanchor_1858_1858" id="FNanchor_1858_1858"></a><a href="#Footnote_1858_1858" class="fnanchor">[1858]</a> is all that longitudinal portion of
the wing that lies between the postcostal and the anal
nervures; and the <i>Anal Area</i><a name="FNanchor_1859_1859" id="FNanchor_1859_1859"></a><a href="#Footnote_1859_1859" class="fnanchor">[1859]</a> is all that longitudinal
portion of the wing that lies between the anal nervure
and the posterior margin. But there are other helps to
enable you to distinguish the areas in the different Orders.
The Anal Area in all Orders forms the posterior <i>fold</i> of
the wing; in <i>Coleoptera</i> turned under when in repose; in
<i>Orthoptera</i> folded like a fan; in <i>Lepidoptera</i>, in some
<i>PapilionidÃ¦</i>, forming an arch over the abdomen. Again,
in <i>Blatta</i>, the Costal Area is distinguished chiefly by <i>longitudinal</i>
nervures; the Intermediate by <i>oblique</i> ones; and
the Anal by <i>radiating</i> ones; and in both this tribe and
the <i>MantidÃ¦</i> this last Area is marked out from the Intermediate
by a marginal notch, which is not present in
<i>Phasma</i>, but is found in both sections of the <i>Hemiptera</i>.
In <i>Locusta</i> Leach the notch is between the Costal and
Intermediate Areas: in <i>Phasma</i> the nervures of the Intermediate
Area are branches of the externo-medial, while
those of the Anal, as they do in all the <i>Orthoptera</i>, diverge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>
from the base of the wing: in many, as in <i>Pterophylla</i> K.,
the part of the wing lately alluded to, that is longer than
the <i>tegmen</i>, and of the same substance, points out the limit
of the Costal Area; and in others this part terminates in
a segment of a circle and is differently reticulated at the
apex from the Intermediate: in the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>
and the <i>Libellulina</i>, in which the areas at first seem
indistinct, they may generally be easily traced by following
them from the axes. The separation of the Costal
from the Intermediate in the remaining Orders seems less
easy on account of the branching of the nervures: in the
rest of the <i>Neuroptera</i> and the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, if the posterior
branches of the postcostal nervure are not included,
you will have a narrow Postcostal Area, which in most
cases forms an angle more or less prominent, in <i>Corydalis</i>
almost a right angle, with the Intermediate: in <i>Hemerobius</i>
and affinities this part is distinguished by areolets formed
by <i>transverse</i> nervures, while those of the rest of the
wing are <i>longitudinal</i><a name="FNanchor_1860_1860" id="FNanchor_1860_1860"></a><a href="#Footnote_1860_1860" class="fnanchor">[1860]</a>: but if the posterior branches are
included, the Costal Area will be more ample: a similar
observation applies to the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>; in
these, in all cases, the areolets adjoining the anterior margin,
which follow the <i>stigma</i>, should be regarded as belonging
to the Area in question<a name="FNanchor_1861_1861" id="FNanchor_1861_1861"></a><a href="#Footnote_1861_1861" class="fnanchor">[1861]</a>. In those tribes of the
former Order, whose wings are without <i>nervures</i>, the
areas are often marked by <i>folds</i>.</p>

<p>M. Chabrier has observed that in <i>Coleoptera</i> the specific
weight of the margin of the wing, and its means of
resistance, are augmented by a liquid which is introduced,
at the will of the animal, into a long pocket under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
<i>brachial</i>, here called the <i>costal</i> and <i>mediastinal</i> nervures,
covered by a supple membrane, which in a state of repose
becomes flaccid<a name="FNanchor_1862_1862" id="FNanchor_1862_1862"></a><a href="#Footnote_1862_1862" class="fnanchor">[1862]</a>: it is easily detected, being of a paler
colour than the nervures between which it lies; this is
what I call the <i>Phialum</i>; we have before seen that it
exists also in <i>Elytra</i> and some <i>Hemelytra</i><a name="FNanchor_1863_1863" id="FNanchor_1863_1863"></a><a href="#Footnote_1863_1863" class="fnanchor">[1863]</a>; but I have
not detected it in any other <i>wings</i>.</p>

<p>I have before given you a sufficiently full account of
the <i>alulÃ¦</i> or winglets of <i>Diptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1864_1864" id="FNanchor_1864_1864"></a><a href="#Footnote_1864_1864" class="fnanchor">[1864]</a>; and shall here only
observe that they are not confined to <i>one</i> particular tribe,
as has been usually imagined; but though sometimes
extremely minute, simple, and not easily detected, are an
<i>universal</i> distinction of the Order.</p>

<p>Having thus endeavoured to elucidate the <i>larger</i> Areas
into which wings appear to be divided; I shall next
say something on the <i>smaller</i> ones produced by the intersection
or ramification of the nervures; these had
been named areolets (<i>areolÃ¦</i>) several years before M.
Jurine's work, in which he calls them, I think <i>improperly</i>,
cellules (<i>cellulÃ¦</i>), was published; I therefore retain
the <i>prior</i> term. The general structure of the nervures
of the wings of insects having been before explained<a name="FNanchor_1865_1865" id="FNanchor_1865_1865"></a><a href="#Footnote_1865_1865" class="fnanchor">[1865]</a>, I
shall not here repeat what I then said; but there is a curious
circumstance connected with it, particularly visible in the
wings of certain <i>Hymenoptera</i>, that I must not pass without
notice. If you examine attentively with a microscope
against the light the wing of any <i>Nomada</i> or <i>Andrena</i>,
you will discover little transparent points in some of the
smaller transverse nervures that form the middle areolets,
in which the nervure becomes white and looks as if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
was interrupted, though in substance it seems continued:
these little points, somewhat resembling minute air bubbles
detained in the tubes, are what M. Jurine, who first
discovered them, has, on that account, named <i>bullÃ¦</i>, which
he thus further describes:&mdash;"When the tube (of the nervure)
arrives at the spot where a <i>bulla</i> is to be formed, it
extends itself on all sides in minute threads in the upper
membrane of the wing, losing its colour and tubular structure,
which it resumes immediately after the formation
of the bulla<a name="FNanchor_1866_1866" id="FNanchor_1866_1866"></a><a href="#Footnote_1866_1866" class="fnanchor">[1866]</a>." But if you look closely at them you will
find that there is always a slight <i>fold</i> of the wing that
cuts the nervure exactly at the <i>bullÃ¦</i>, and if the fold
changes its direction they accompany it; their object,
therefore, is clearly to relax the tension so as to admit a
little motion where the fold is; consequently, rather than
<i>bullÃ¦</i> (bubbles), they should be denominated <i>articulations</i>.
A similar construction, but on a larger scale, may be observed
in the wings of <i>Coleoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1867_1867" id="FNanchor_1867_1867"></a><a href="#Footnote_1867_1867" class="fnanchor">[1867]</a> and some others, as
<i>Psocus</i>, where the folds traverse the nervures. I shall next
make a few observations on the principal nervures; and first
a word upon their <i>names</i>. M. Jurine, being of opinion
that a striking analogy exists between the wings of <i>insects</i>
and those of <i>birds</i>, in which M. Chabrier seems to agree
with him, has named the nervures in the anterior margin
of the wings of the former, <i>radius</i> and <i>cubitus</i>, as corresponding
with the bones so named in the fore-arm of the
latter, and the plate which often terminates these nervures
in <i>Hymenoptera</i>, he names the <i>carpus</i>; it may look
like presumption to differ from two such weighty authorities,
but as their observations seem to have been too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
limited, in one case to the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i> only;
and in various Orders there is nothing analogous to
the <i>stigma</i> or <i>carpus</i>, and all the other nervures of an insect's
wing have no analogue in that of a bird, but more
especially as M. Latreille seems to think with me on this
subject<a name="FNanchor_1868_1868" id="FNanchor_1868_1868"></a><a href="#Footnote_1868_1868" class="fnanchor">[1868]</a>, I have retained LinnÃ©'s term for the marginal
nervure, and for most of the others have adopted those
of the great French Entomologist just mentioned. I
shall here only further observe,&mdash;and it seems to me an
observation of prime importance, in the determination of
the question of the analogy of the wings of insects,&mdash;that
they are not, as in birds, the <i>fore-leg</i> converted into an
organ of flight, but, like the wing of the <i>Draco</i>, an organ
<i>superadded</i> to the legs; and, further, that the connection
is not with the fore-legs, but, as has been before observed<a name="FNanchor_1869_1869" id="FNanchor_1869_1869"></a><a href="#Footnote_1869_1869" class="fnanchor">[1869]</a>,
with the two posterior pairs.</p>

<p>The <i>Costa</i><a name="FNanchor_1870_1870" id="FNanchor_1870_1870"></a><a href="#Footnote_1870_1870" class="fnanchor">[1870]</a> is usually the strongest of the nervures,
and that upon which the wing seems to be built; but in
some cases, as in <i>Blatta</i>, <i>Scutellera</i>, <i>Cynips</i>, &amp;c., it is represented
by the mere membrane of the anterior margin;
in some <i>Coleoptera</i>, as in <i>Geotrupes</i>, <i>Dytiscus</i>, &amp;c., its structure,
except at the base, appears to be annular or nearly
so, at least a vast number of corrugations, running transversely,
are observable on its upper and lower surfaces;
it is thus capable of greater tension and relaxation, and
more flexile. The <i>stigma</i> or <i>carpus</i><a name="FNanchor_1871_1871" id="FNanchor_1871_1871"></a><a href="#Footnote_1871_1871" class="fnanchor">[1871]</a>, though most conspicuous
in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> Order, may be traced in some
<i>Coleoptera</i>, Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, the <i>Libellulina</i>,
&amp;c.; but it has no representative in the <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
<i>Trichoptera</i>, &amp;c. The <i>mediastinal</i> is usually a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
very slender nervure, placed between the <i>costa</i> and <i>postcosta</i>,
sometimes terminating in the former<a name="FNanchor_1872_1872" id="FNanchor_1872_1872"></a><a href="#Footnote_1872_1872" class="fnanchor">[1872]</a>, and at others
in the latter<a name="FNanchor_1873_1873" id="FNanchor_1873_1873"></a><a href="#Footnote_1873_1873" class="fnanchor">[1873]</a>: in the <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>, &amp;c., however,
and some others, it is a very conspicuous and principal
one<a href="#Footnote_1873_1873" class="fnanchor">[1873]</a>; in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> it is obsolete, merging
in those nervures<a name="FNanchor_1874_1874" id="FNanchor_1874_1874"></a><a href="#Footnote_1874_1874" class="fnanchor">[1874]</a>. The <i>Postcosta</i> is the principal nervure
of the wing in <i>Scutellera</i>, but in <i>Staphylinus</i> it is
wanting; in <i>Chalcis sispes</i> it is the only true nervure of
that organ, the others being represented by spurious
ones<a name="FNanchor_1875_1875" id="FNanchor_1875_1875"></a><a href="#Footnote_1875_1875" class="fnanchor">[1875]</a>. The <i>externomedial</i> and <i>internomedial</i> are sometimes
distinct at their origin, but more frequently are
branches from a common stem.</p>

<p>Having made these <i>general</i> remarks, I shall now consider
<i>particularly</i> the <i>neuration</i> of the wings in the different
Orders, beginning with the <i>Coleoptera</i>. The first
thing that strikes the physiologist in surveying a wing belonging
to an insect of this Order, is the general arrangement
of the nervures<a name="FNanchor_1876_1876" id="FNanchor_1876_1876"></a><a href="#Footnote_1876_1876" class="fnanchor">[1876]</a>; which are so placed that the
required degree of tension may be given to every part of
this organ: thus some are nearly straight<a name="FNanchor_1877_1877" id="FNanchor_1877_1877"></a><a href="#Footnote_1877_1877" class="fnanchor">[1877]</a>; others run in
a serpentine direction<a name="FNanchor_1878_1878" id="FNanchor_1878_1878"></a><a href="#Footnote_1878_1878" class="fnanchor">[1878]</a>; others are forked with one branch
recurrent and another proceeding onwards<a name="FNanchor_1879_1879" id="FNanchor_1879_1879"></a><a href="#Footnote_1879_1879" class="fnanchor">[1879]</a>; others again
are insulated, or do not originate from the base of the wing,
or from other nervures, but are merely placed to strengthen
an open space of it<a name="FNanchor_1880_1880" id="FNanchor_1880_1880"></a><a href="#Footnote_1880_1880" class="fnanchor">[1880]</a>: these nervures are also usually
broader and more substantial than those of the wings of
the subsequent Orders. Another striking circumstance
with regard to them is that the nervures form few or no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>
closed areolets, except in the Costal Area, where they
are inconspicuous; in <i>Dytiscus marginalis</i>, indeed, and
<i>Tenebrio Molitor</i> one or two may be found, but in general
there are none. In many of this tribe the <i>postcosta</i>,
which terminates at the joint of the wing, becomes
recurrent, so as to form a hook, which perhaps represents
the <i>stigma</i>, as in <i>Dynastes</i><a name="FNanchor_1881_1881" id="FNanchor_1881_1881"></a><a href="#Footnote_1881_1881" class="fnanchor">[1881]</a>; in <i>Creophilus</i> K., a
rove-beetle, there is no hook but a broad plate adjacent
to the <i>costa</i>. In the <i>Strepsiptera</i> Order the neuration
is extremely simple, the nervures, except one
insulated one, diverging from the base of the wing<a name="FNanchor_1882_1882" id="FNanchor_1882_1882"></a><a href="#Footnote_1882_1882" class="fnanchor">[1882]</a>:
in this respect, as well as in the form of that organ,
an approach is made to the <i>Orthoptera</i>. In the <i>Dermaptera</i>
this approach is still more evident; in the common
earwig<a name="FNanchor_1883_1883" id="FNanchor_1883_1883"></a><a href="#Footnote_1883_1883" class="fnanchor">[1883]</a>, the diverging nervures become numerous; between
each is an insulated one, taking its origin in the
middle of the wing, and running to the margin; a little
nearer to the latter all the nervures are dilated into a
plate; those of the anal area are angular<a name="FNanchor_1884_1884" id="FNanchor_1884_1884"></a><a href="#Footnote_1884_1884" class="fnanchor">[1884]</a>, and the exposed
part of the costal is as hard as the elytra. The
neuration in the <i>Orthoptera</i> Order may be called <i>radiate</i>,
the longitudinal nervures for the most part diverging from
the base of the wing like <i>rays</i>: in some few instances<a name="FNanchor_1885_1885" id="FNanchor_1885_1885"></a><a href="#Footnote_1885_1885" class="fnanchor">[1885]</a>,
but not often, I believe, an insulated nervure intervenes
between each; traversing or connecting nervures, cutting
the longitudinal ones in various directions, ornament these
wings with an infinity of areolets, causing them to resemble
fine gauze or beautiful lace or net-work; very often
these areolets are quadrangular, sometimes rhomboidal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
frequently nearly circular, and differing occasionally, as
has been before observed<a name="FNanchor_1886_1886" id="FNanchor_1886_1886"></a><a href="#Footnote_1886_1886" class="fnanchor">[1886]</a>, in the different areas: it sometimes
occurs that there are no traversing nervures<a name="FNanchor_1887_1887" id="FNanchor_1887_1887"></a><a href="#Footnote_1887_1887" class="fnanchor">[1887]</a>, when
the wing of course is without areolets. In the Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i> the type of neuration, as to the wing,
seems borrowed from the <i>Coleoptera</i>, a further proof that
these are the analogues of that Order amongst the <i>Haustellata</i>
Clairv. In these the nervures usually are few
and dispersed, and seldom form any closed areolets. If
you examine any <i>Scutellera</i>, <i>Pentatoma</i>, or <i>LygÃ¦us</i>, you
may trace the uncinated, forked, serpentine, and insulated
nervures of Coleopterous insects; in <i>Gerris</i> and
<i>Velia</i> there is an approach to the neuration of some
<i>Homopterous</i> species, and in <i>Belostoma</i> &amp;c. the wing is
reticulated by <i>spurious</i> nervures. In the Homopterous
section there are several types of neuration; thus the <i>FulgorÃ¦</i>
resemble the <i>Orthoptera</i> in this respect; while the
<i>TettigoniÃ¦</i> F., &amp;c., approach nearer to the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i>, and have their apical areolets circumscribed
<i>within</i> the margin by a traversing nervure; in <i>Flata</i>,
&amp;c., the areolets are mostly formed, not by traversing
nervures, but by the branching of the longitudinal ones;
in this respect they are not unlike the <i>Lepidoptera</i>. In
this last-named Order there are some variations with regard
to their neuration&mdash;thus, amongst the <i>butterflies</i> in
<i>Urania</i>, &amp;c., there is no closed areolet in any of the
wings, and almost all the nervures diverge from the base<a name="FNanchor_1888_1888" id="FNanchor_1888_1888"></a><a href="#Footnote_1888_1888" class="fnanchor">[1888]</a>;
in <i>Morpho</i>, &amp;c., there is only one in the primary wing<a name="FNanchor_1889_1889" id="FNanchor_1889_1889"></a><a href="#Footnote_1889_1889" class="fnanchor">[1889]</a>;
in <i>Heliconia</i>, &amp;c., there is one in both wings; amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
the <i>moths</i>, in the <i>Bombyces</i> L., this is divided into <i>two</i>, and
in <i>Cossus labyrinthicus</i> Don. into <i>three</i> areolets: in some
butterflies (<i>LycÃ¦na</i>) there is one insulated nervure<a name="FNanchor_1890_1890" id="FNanchor_1890_1890"></a><a href="#Footnote_1890_1890" class="fnanchor">[1890]</a>, and
in others (<i>Hesperia</i>) there are two<a name="FNanchor_1891_1891" id="FNanchor_1891_1891"></a><a href="#Footnote_1891_1891" class="fnanchor">[1891]</a>; in these two last,
and <i>Heliconia</i>, <i>Urania</i>, &amp;c., the end of the Costal Area
is divided into several areolets by oblique nervures<a name="FNanchor_1892_1892" id="FNanchor_1892_1892"></a><a href="#Footnote_1892_1892" class="fnanchor">[1892]</a>,
which gives them some analogy to the wings of many
<i>Neuroptera</i>; and at the base of this Area, in <i>Morpho</i>, is
a roundish areolet<a name="FNanchor_1893_1893" id="FNanchor_1893_1893"></a><a href="#Footnote_1893_1893" class="fnanchor">[1893]</a>. In this Order the externo-medial
and interno-medial nervures coalesce into one, and are
only represented separately by their first and third
branches<a name="FNanchor_1894_1894" id="FNanchor_1894_1894"></a><a href="#Footnote_1894_1894" class="fnanchor">[1894]</a>. In the <i>Neuroptera</i> Order the general type of
neuration is borrowed from the <i>Orthoptera</i>; but in <i>Osmylus</i>,
<i>Termes</i>, &amp;c., there is an approach to that of <i>Flata</i>
in the Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, and in <i>Psocus</i> to others
of that section; in the second of these genera the nervures,
except those of the costal margin, are spurious.</p>

<p>I now come to the Order in which M. Jurine has laboured
with so much success, I mean the <i>Hymenoptera</i>;
and I only regret that his labours were directed to so
small a portion of the Class <i>Insecta</i>, and in that portion
only to a part of the upper wing; I say only a <i>part</i>, because
all those areolets of the posterior part of the wing,
in some cases amounting to <i>five</i><a name="FNanchor_1895_1895" id="FNanchor_1895_1895"></a><a href="#Footnote_1895_1895" class="fnanchor">[1895]</a>, that lie behind his <i>cubital
cellules</i>, are not employed by him as diagnostics, and
are left without a name. By dividing the areolets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>
Intermediate Area of these wings into <i>three</i> portions, the
<i>basal</i>, <i>medial</i>, and <i>apical</i><a name="FNanchor_1896_1896" id="FNanchor_1896_1896"></a><a href="#Footnote_1896_1896" class="fnanchor">[1896]</a>, I have endeavoured to remedy
this defect, and by naming each set of areolets in
the middle portion, as you will see in the Orismological
Definitions, under the term <i>Areolets</i>, you will find it
easy to describe any given areolet and its place in the
wing; those of the base may be called the <i>anterior</i>, <i>intermediate</i>,
and <i>posterior</i>, where <i>three</i> occur; and the first
and last of these terms will suffice where there are only
<i>two</i>; the apical areolets, or those that are open to the
margin, may be called, <i>first</i>, <i>second</i>, and <i>third</i> in the
order of their occurrence, reckoning from the anterior or
costal margin.</p>

<p>In this Order it is curious to trace the progress of neuration
in the wings of different genera. Thus in <i>Psilus</i>
only the <i>costal</i> nervure and the <i>stigma</i> are to be traced<a name="FNanchor_1897_1897" id="FNanchor_1897_1897"></a><a href="#Footnote_1897_1897" class="fnanchor">[1897]</a>;
in <i>Chalcis</i> the <i>postcostal</i> and <i>stigma</i><a name="FNanchor_1898_1898" id="FNanchor_1898_1898"></a><a href="#Footnote_1898_1898" class="fnanchor">[1898]</a>; in <i>Codrus</i> and <i>Leucospis</i>
the <i>costal</i>, <i>postcostal</i>, <i>stigma</i>, and a nervure representing
the <i>externo-medial</i> and <i>interno-medial</i> coalescing
into one<a name="FNanchor_1899_1899" id="FNanchor_1899_1899"></a><a href="#Footnote_1899_1899" class="fnanchor">[1899]</a>; in <i>Omalus</i> the <i>basilar</i> areolets appear<a name="FNanchor_1900_1900" id="FNanchor_1900_1900"></a><a href="#Footnote_1900_1900" class="fnanchor">[1900]</a>; in
<i>Crabro</i> both <i>basilar</i> and <i>medial</i><a name="FNanchor_1901_1901" id="FNanchor_1901_1901"></a><a href="#Footnote_1901_1901" class="fnanchor">[1901]</a>; in <i>Cynips basilar</i>,
<i>medial</i>, and <i>apical</i><a name="FNanchor_1902_1902" id="FNanchor_1902_1902"></a><a href="#Footnote_1902_1902" class="fnanchor">[1902]</a>; and in <i>Hylotoma</i> the wing is filled
with its greatest complement of areolets<a name="FNanchor_1903_1903" id="FNanchor_1903_1903"></a><a href="#Footnote_1903_1903" class="fnanchor">[1903]</a>. The medial
areolets of the Intermediate Area, as you will see in the
definitions, form <i>three</i> distinct series; these may be called
the <i>protomesal</i>, <i>deuteromesal</i>, and <i>tritomesal</i>, reckoning
from the postcostal areolets; the first of these corresponds
with the cubital cellules of Jurine. These series may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
expressed, according to the number of their areolets; by
figures, the protomesal standing first. They vary much
in this respect in the different genera. Thus in <i>Cyclostoma</i>
K.<a name="FNanchor_1904_1904" id="FNanchor_1904_1904"></a><a href="#Footnote_1904_1904" class="fnanchor">[1904]</a>, reckoning the didymous areolet as two, the
numbers will stand 4:2:1; in <i>Hylotoma</i>, &amp;c., 3:2:1<a name="FNanchor_1905_1905" id="FNanchor_1905_1905"></a><a href="#Footnote_1905_1905" class="fnanchor">[1905]</a>;
in <i>Aulacus</i>, &amp;c., 2:2:1<a name="FNanchor_1906_1906" id="FNanchor_1906_1906"></a><a href="#Footnote_1906_1906" class="fnanchor">[1906]</a>; in <i>Bracon</i>, &amp;c., 2:1:1<a name="FNanchor_1907_1907" id="FNanchor_1907_1907"></a><a href="#Footnote_1907_1907" class="fnanchor">[1907]</a>; in
<i>Chelonus</i>, 2:0:1<a name="FNanchor_1908_1908" id="FNanchor_1908_1908"></a><a href="#Footnote_1908_1908" class="fnanchor">[1908]</a>; in <i>Cynips erythrocephalus</i> Jur., 2:0:0<a name="FNanchor_1909_1909" id="FNanchor_1909_1909"></a><a href="#Footnote_1909_1909" class="fnanchor">[1909]</a>;
in <i>Formica</i>, 1:1:1<a name="FNanchor_1910_1910" id="FNanchor_1910_1910"></a><a href="#Footnote_1910_1910" class="fnanchor">[1910]</a>; in <i>Oxybelus</i>, 1:0:1<a name="FNanchor_1911_1911" id="FNanchor_1911_1911"></a><a href="#Footnote_1911_1911" class="fnanchor">[1911]</a>; in <i>Chrysis</i>,
0:1:1<a name="FNanchor_1912_1912" id="FNanchor_1912_1912"></a><a href="#Footnote_1912_1912" class="fnanchor">[1912]</a>; and in <i>Cynips Rubi</i> K., 1:0:0<a name="FNanchor_1913_1913" id="FNanchor_1913_1913"></a><a href="#Footnote_1913_1913" class="fnanchor">[1913]</a>. The most
natural number is 3:2:1. The next in importance to
the medial areolets of the Intermediate Area are the
<i>apical</i>, or those open to the margin; the most usual number
of them, excluding the postcostal areolets which belong
to the Costal Area, is <i>three</i>; but in <i>Sirex</i> there is
an approach to <i>four</i><a name="FNanchor_1914_1914" id="FNanchor_1914_1914"></a><a href="#Footnote_1914_1914" class="fnanchor">[1914]</a>; in <i>Evania</i> there are only <i>two</i><a name="FNanchor_1915_1915" id="FNanchor_1915_1915"></a><a href="#Footnote_1915_1915" class="fnanchor">[1915]</a>;
and in <i>Philanthus</i> there are none<a name="FNanchor_1916_1916" id="FNanchor_1916_1916"></a><a href="#Footnote_1916_1916" class="fnanchor">[1916]</a>; in many, as <i>Prosopis</i>,
<i>Nomada</i>, <i>Andrena</i><a name="FNanchor_1917_1917" id="FNanchor_1917_1917"></a><a href="#Footnote_1917_1917" class="fnanchor">[1917]</a>, though there is the usual number,
they are incomplete and do not reach the margin.
The <i>basal</i> areas are of little importance in assisting to
determine genera; they are most commonly <i>two</i> in number,
but in <i>Cynips</i>, &amp;c., there is only <i>one</i><a name="FNanchor_1918_1918" id="FNanchor_1918_1918"></a><a href="#Footnote_1918_1918" class="fnanchor">[1918]</a>. The shape
and other circumstances of the areolets vary considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
in different genera and species: upon these however
I shall not enlarge further, but proceed in the next place
to consider very briefly the wings of the <i>Diptera</i> Order
as to their neuration. These are not so easily made subservient
to a general plan. The <i>basilar</i> areolets are now
reduced considerably in length, occupying merely the base
of the wing<a name="FNanchor_1919_1919" id="FNanchor_1919_1919"></a><a href="#Footnote_1919_1919" class="fnanchor">[1919]</a>; the <i>medial</i> are become less numerous and
important<a name="FNanchor_1920_1920" id="FNanchor_1920_1920"></a><a href="#Footnote_1920_1920" class="fnanchor">[1920]</a>; and the <i>apical</i>, in a variety of instances, are
the most conspicuous<a name="FNanchor_1921_1921" id="FNanchor_1921_1921"></a><a href="#Footnote_1921_1921" class="fnanchor">[1921]</a>; in some wings, as in those of
<i>Penthetria</i>, the Intermediate Area has no nervures or
areolets, or only spurious ones; in <i>Psychoda</i> the nervures
diverge from the base almost without branching, so as to
form no closed areolets<a name="FNanchor_1922_1922" id="FNanchor_1922_1922"></a><a href="#Footnote_1922_1922" class="fnanchor">[1922]</a>; in many, the lower medial
areolets are very long, resembling the basilar in <i>Hymenoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1923_1923" id="FNanchor_1923_1923"></a><a href="#Footnote_1923_1923" class="fnanchor">[1923]</a>;
these are often crowned by a single small one,
as in the <i>StratyomidÃ¦</i>, <i>Tipula</i>, &amp;c., from which numerous
branches proceed to the margin<a name="FNanchor_1924_1924" id="FNanchor_1924_1924"></a><a href="#Footnote_1924_1924" class="fnanchor">[1924]</a>; but in <i>Musca</i> two
large ones approach the margin, the anterior one having
an angle open to it<a name="FNanchor_1925_1925" id="FNanchor_1925_1925"></a><a href="#Footnote_1925_1925" class="fnanchor">[1925]</a>; in the <i>HippoboscidÃ¦</i> almost the
whole of the wing is occupied by the apical areolets<a name="FNanchor_1926_1926" id="FNanchor_1926_1926"></a><a href="#Footnote_1926_1926" class="fnanchor">[1926]</a>;
though in some cases they are incomplete<a name="FNanchor_1927_1927" id="FNanchor_1927_1927"></a><a href="#Footnote_1927_1927" class="fnanchor">[1927]</a>.</p>

<p>4. I am next to consider the <i>position</i> of wings in <i>repose</i>
and their <i>folding</i>. The most important object of this is
that when unemployed they may occupy less space, be
less in the way of the insect, and be most effectually protected
from injury. Another end is also served by this
structure,&mdash;that wings can thus be very ample, and present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>
a large surface to the action of the atmosphere without
incommoding the insect when it has not occasion to
use them.</p>

<p>With respect to this head, insects may be divided into
<i>two</i> classes&mdash;namely, those whose wings in repose are
covered by wing-cases harder than the wings themselves,
and those that have no such protection. In the former
the wings, though the rule admits several exceptions, have
more folds than in the latter. As the different mode of
folding the wings has been assumed for a characteristic
of the earlier Orders, I shall explain to you with as much
brevity as possible how each is circumstanced in this respect,
beginning as usual with the <i>Coleoptera</i>.</p>

<p>There are <i>two</i> principal folds of the wing in this Order,
which may be named the <i>anal</i> and the <i>apical</i>: the <i>former</i>
is when the Anal Area or part of it is folded on the
under surface of the base of the wing; this fold is always
more or less <i>longitudinal</i>: the <i>latter</i>, the apical fold, is
by means of the <i>commissura</i> or joint of the <i>postcosta</i> lately
mentioned: which in <i>Hister</i>, <i>Staphylinus</i>, &amp;c., for obvious
reasons<a name="FNanchor_1928_1928" id="FNanchor_1928_1928"></a><a href="#Footnote_1928_1928" class="fnanchor">[1928]</a> is nearer the base of the wing; in <i>Necrophorus</i>
in the middle; in <i>Dynastes Aloeus</i> beyond the middle<a name="FNanchor_1929_1929" id="FNanchor_1929_1929"></a><a href="#Footnote_1929_1929" class="fnanchor">[1929]</a>;
in <i>Tenebrio Molitor</i> near the apex; and in <i>Dytiscus
marginalis</i> there appears to be no joint at all; but the
fact is, that in this insect the <i>postcosta</i>,&mdash;the termination
of which really forms the joint, the <i>costa</i> itself being only
flexible at that point,&mdash;stands at a greater distance from
the latter at its end. Well, at this joint the above fold
is made, the apex of the wing, being first folded longitudinally,
turning under and inwards, and forming an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>
angle, more or less acute, with the joint or costal margin,
so that the fold is not quite but nearly transverse: this
at least is the case in <i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i> and other
Lamellicorns: in <i>Staphylinus</i>, &amp;c., there are several
transverse and longitudinal folds, and thus the wing is
more easily packed under the short elytra; in <i>Molorchus</i>,
<i>Necydalis</i>, &amp;c., in which it is left uncovered, except at its
base, the anal fold takes place, and the apical in some
degree; a short portion near the apex forming an obtuse
angle with the margin; in <i>Atractocerus</i> the wing appears
to be only <i>longitudinally</i> folded; and in <i>Buprestis vittata</i>
only the <i>anal</i> fold is to be detected. Besides these transverse
and longitudinal folds these organs, in many beetles,
have an infinity of fine corrugations, which ramify
like the nervures of the <i>tegmina</i> of <i>Flata</i><a name="FNanchor_1930_1930" id="FNanchor_1930_1930"></a><a href="#Footnote_1930_1930" class="fnanchor">[1930]</a>, &amp;c., proceeding
from the Costal Area or the disk of the wing to the posterior
margin; the object of these plicatures is doubtless
to present a more ample surface to the action of the atmosphere
in flight<a name="FNanchor_1931_1931" id="FNanchor_1931_1931"></a><a href="#Footnote_1931_1931" class="fnanchor">[1931]</a>. When all these folds have been
made in a Coleopterous wing, the apex of the one at its
posterior margin crosses or rests upon that of the other<a name="FNanchor_1932_1932" id="FNanchor_1932_1932"></a><a href="#Footnote_1932_1932" class="fnanchor">[1932]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Dermaptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1933_1933" id="FNanchor_1933_1933"></a><a href="#Footnote_1933_1933" class="fnanchor">[1933]</a>, at least the common earwig,
there is a triple transverse fold of the wing, and besides
this it has numerous longitudinal ones like those of a fan,
each of the diverging nervures representing one of the
sticks. In the <i>Strepsiptera</i> the folds are only longitudinal;
a circumstance which, besides the form and neuration
of the wing, sufficiently attests that its station is more
near the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Coleoptera</i> than the <i>Diptera</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
We next come to the <i>Orthoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_1934_1934" id="FNanchor_1934_1934"></a><a href="#Footnote_1934_1934" class="fnanchor">[1934]</a>; in these the folds in
general are longitudinal; and those of the Anal Area in
particular, either in whole or in part, exact counterparts
of a fan: wherever there is a straight nervure, there is
usually a fold or a tendency to it; this is the case even
with the short oblique ones observable in the Intermediate
Area of <i>Blatta</i>: in this tribe the Anal Area, or a
considerable portion of it, is folded under the rest of the
wing, and the whole lies on the back of the animal, so
that in this wing there are only two primary folds; but
in those with a narrower body, as <i>Phasma</i>, &amp;c., there
are more, and the Anal Area, folded like a fan, lies horizontally
on the back; the Costal is vertically applied to
the sides, and the Intermediate is between both, as in the
<i>tegmina</i><a name="FNanchor_1935_1935" id="FNanchor_1935_1935"></a><a href="#Footnote_1935_1935" class="fnanchor">[1935]</a>. In <i>Gryllus</i> Latr., <i>Gryllotalpa</i>, &amp;c., when the
wings are folded, the end of the Anal Area projects so as
to present the appearance of two tails<a name="FNanchor_1936_1936" id="FNanchor_1936_1936"></a><a href="#Footnote_1936_1936" class="fnanchor">[1936]</a>; and in that remarkable
Chinese animal <i>Gryllus monstrosus</i>, in which
these tails are very long, they are convolute like those
of some quadrupeds<a name="FNanchor_1937_1937" id="FNanchor_1937_1937"></a><a href="#Footnote_1937_1937" class="fnanchor">[1937]</a>. It is to be observed that in the
secondary folds of these wings the angles of the folds are
surmounted by a nervure.</p>

<p>In both sections of the <i>Hemiptera</i> Order, as in the <i>Coleoptera</i>,
the Anal Area is turned under the wing and lies
over the back of the insect; this is the only <i>primary</i> fold,
but besides there are several longitudinal semifolds or
<i>secondary</i> ones, in which one part of the surface forms an
obtuse angle with another; and in <i>Tettigonia</i>, &amp;c., these
folds ramify in the wings as well as in the <i>tegmina</i> at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
margin: a number of semifolds also, sometimes transverse
and sometimes oblique, run in pairs from each side
of every nervure of the disk of both <i>tegmina</i> and wings in
the genus last named, the use of which has been before
mentioned<a name="FNanchor_1938_1938" id="FNanchor_1938_1938"></a><a href="#Footnote_1938_1938" class="fnanchor">[1938]</a>.</p>

<p>We now come to those Orders that have <i>four</i> membranous
wings: first, I shall consider the <i>Lepidoptera</i>.
With respect to the position of their wings in repose some
variations take place. In the majority of the <i>day-fliers</i>
(<i>Papilio</i> L.), when the animal reposes the wings are applied
to each other by their upper surface so as to be
<i>vertical</i>; but in the skippers (<i>Hesperia</i>), the secondary
wings assume a <i>horizontal</i> position, while the primary are
<i>vertical</i> but applied to each other. In the <i>Crepuscular</i>
tribes (<i>Sphinx</i> L.) the upper wings are incumbent on the
lower, and deflexed. In the <i>night-fliers</i> (<i>PhalÃ¦na</i> L.)
the types of position are various. In some <i>Attacus</i>, <i>Saturnia</i>,
<i>Noctua</i>, &amp;c., the wings cover each other, and are
a little inclined from a horizontal position; in <i>Gastropacha</i>,
<i>Odenesis</i>, and some other <i>BombycidÃ¦</i>, they are deflexed,
and the anterior margin of the under wing projects
beyond that of the upper: in some of the <i>TineÃ¦</i> L.,
as <i>Crambus</i>, the wings are convoluted, and in others,
<i>Galleria</i>, they are applied close to the sides of the body,
and being elevated at the apex, terminate, to use a French
term&mdash;<i>en queue de coq</i>: in <i>Noctua</i>, <i>Geometra</i>, &amp;c., the
wings usually cover the abdomen, and are nearly horizontal.
With regard to the <i>folds</i> of their wings, the
Anal Area of the secondary is the only part that has any
striking one; in <i>Papilio Hector</i> and affinities it turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
up so as to defend the sides and part of the back of the
abdomen; in <i>Morpho Teucer</i> it turns down, and meeting
that of the opposite wing, forms a semitube which receives
and shelters that part below. In the <i>Crepuscular</i>
and <i>Nocturnal</i> Lepidoptera this fold, especially in the
former, is very slight. With respect to semifolds in the
<i>Diurnal</i>, there is one originating in the disk, between each
of the nervures, that goes to the margin of the wing; likewise
the under wings, particularly of many <i>NoctuÃ¦</i>, <i>ArctiÃ¦</i>,
&amp;c., have many longitudinal semifolds.</p>

<p>In the <i>Neuroptera</i> Order several variations take place
with regard to the <i>position</i> of these organs in repose:
thus, in <i>Ãshna</i>, <i>Libellula</i>, &amp;c., they continue expanded;
in <i>Argion</i> they are applied to the body; in <i>Myrmeleon</i>
the upper are horizontally incumbent on the lower;
in <i>Hemerobius</i> they incline to the horizon. With regard
to their <i>folds</i> in <i>Ãshna</i>, &amp;c., the longitudinal nervures
alternately form the summit or the bottom of a semifold,
as do those branches that terminate in the posterior margin;
this kind of plicature may be observed, but in a less
degree, in <i>Ascalaphus</i>, <i>Myrmeleon</i>, &amp;c.; in <i>Panorpa</i> every
nervure is the ridge of a slight fold; in <i>Termes</i>, on the
contrary, it forms its bottom. In the <i>Trichoptera</i>, the
under wing being much more ample than the upper, the
Anal Area forms a fold under the wing, and there seem
longitudinal secondary folds besides.</p>

<p>We now come to the <i>Hymenoptera</i>. In this Order
the wings, as to their position in repose, are usually incumbent
upon each other, and cover the abdomen; in the
<i>VespidÃ¦</i>, however, they are placed parallel to the body,
but do not cover it. Before I notice the plicature of
these wings, I must recall your attention to what I lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
observed<a name="FNanchor_1939_1939" id="FNanchor_1939_1939"></a><a href="#Footnote_1939_1939" class="fnanchor">[1939]</a> with regard to Jurine's <i>bullÃ¦</i> (bubbles), but
which are really the <i>joints</i> of the nervures, as they are
to be found only where the folds pass; and where they
exist they are an index by which the folds, or rather semifolds,
may be traced. I counted eleven of these little
joints in the upper wing of <i>Andrena cineraria</i>; sometimes,
however, instead of a <i>bulla</i>, a nervure stops short to admit
the fold. Wings in this Order have often three
longitudinal semifolds more or less conspicuous; these
you may trace in the saw-flies (<i>Tenthredo</i> L.), whose
wings LinnÃ© terms <i>tumidÃ¦</i>, by which term he would indicate
the elevation of the whole surface produced by this
structure; in the under wings of these, and <i>Scolia</i>, <i>Bembex</i>,
&amp;c., the Anal Area is turned under the wing, as in
many preceding tribes<a name="FNanchor_1940_1940" id="FNanchor_1940_1940"></a><a href="#Footnote_1940_1940" class="fnanchor">[1940]</a>: in <i>Sirex</i>, &amp;c., that Area of the
upper wing turns upwards, forming an acute angle with
the rest of the organ; the same circumstance distinguishes
the under wing in the <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i>. Several apical
semifolds, marked by a pellucid streak, distinguish
<i>Tiphia</i> F., and in <i>Bombus</i>, <i>Bembex</i>, &amp;c., an infinity of
branching ones, like those before described in <i>Coleoptera</i>,
corrugate the apical margin. In the <i>VespidÃ¦</i> the <i>upper</i>
wings are folded longitudinally into <i>three</i> nearly equal
portions, but in the <i>under</i> ones the Anal Area only forms
the fold.</p>

<p>In the <i>Diptera</i> Order, as to their <i>position</i> when at rest,
the wings are mostly incumbent one on the other; but in
<i>Psychoda</i> they are deflexed, so as to form a kind of penthouse.
With regard to their <i>plication</i>, in some, <i>Tipula
oleracea</i>, &amp;c., a slight oblique semifold runs from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>
<i>stigma</i> to the apical margin, and the Anal Area has two, as it
has in many <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, itself forming nearly a right angle
with the rest of the wing; besides these it is corrugated
with minute transverse semifolds, which are observable also
in several other Dipterous insects; in many <i>StratyomidÃ¦</i>
they are oblique, and run from the disk to the posterior
margin; and in <i>Asilus</i>, <i>Bombylius</i>, &amp;c., they are wavy.</p>

<p>5. We are next to say something upon the <i>shape</i> of wings:
this, though apparently extremely various in the different
Orders and tribes, may I think be traced in every wing
to one original prototype, a <i>triangle</i> with the largest angle
rounded and subtended by the anterior or costal margin:
in some, as the <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>, &amp;c., this type of
formation is a <i>right-angled</i> triangle<a name="FNanchor_1941_1941" id="FNanchor_1941_1941"></a><a href="#Footnote_1941_1941" class="fnanchor">[1941]</a>; and in others, as in
the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c., the majority of the <i>Neuroptera</i>,
&amp;c., it is an <i>obtusangled</i> one<a name="FNanchor_1942_1942" id="FNanchor_1942_1942"></a><a href="#Footnote_1942_1942" class="fnanchor">[1942]</a>; it may be further
observed, that in receding from these forms wings very
often assume that of the half or quadrant of some regular
figure, as we shall see when we consider those of the different
Orders. Another general observation I shall first mention,&mdash;that
these organs are universally narrowest at their
base and widest at the apex, provided we consider as the
apex the termination outwards of the three Areas; otherwise
we might say that wings in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>,
&amp;c., were wider at the base than at the apex<a name="FNanchor_1943_1943" id="FNanchor_1943_1943"></a><a href="#Footnote_1943_1943" class="fnanchor">[1943]</a>. The wings
in the former Order, and in several of the Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, as <i>Gerris</i>, <i>Velia</i>, &amp;c., may in general, as to
their <i>shape</i>, be termed semicordate or semiovate<a name="FNanchor_1944_1944" id="FNanchor_1944_1944"></a><a href="#Footnote_1944_1944" class="fnanchor">[1944]</a>; in the
<i>Dermaptera</i> they incline to an oval figure<a name="FNanchor_1945_1945" id="FNanchor_1945_1945"></a><a href="#Footnote_1945_1945" class="fnanchor">[1945]</a>: in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
<i>Strepsiptera</i>, <i>Orthoptera</i>, most Homopterous and many Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, they approach to the quadrant of
a circle; in a considerable portion of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> the
two under wings, if united at their posterior margin, approach
a circular form; the upper ones vary a little from
the prototype of the under ones, forming an obtusangled
triangle<a name="FNanchor_1946_1946" id="FNanchor_1946_1946"></a><a href="#Footnote_1946_1946" class="fnanchor">[1946]</a>; in many <i>Neuroptera</i> the <i>primary</i> wings may
be called oblong or linear-oblong, while the <i>secondary</i>
betray more evidently the <i>right-angled</i> or <i>obtusangled</i>
triangle; in the <i>Hymenoptera</i> this latter form is every
where conspicuous, with little deviation, except in the
rounding of the angles<a name="FNanchor_1947_1947" id="FNanchor_1947_1947"></a><a href="#Footnote_1947_1947" class="fnanchor">[1947]</a>; and, finally, in the <i>Diptera</i> this
form shades off again into an oblong, ovate, or linear
shape, the wing being most commonly attenuated at the
base into a kind of footstalk<a name="FNanchor_1948_1948" id="FNanchor_1948_1948"></a><a href="#Footnote_1948_1948" class="fnanchor">[1948]</a>. Some singular variations
with respect to the termination or marginal processes of
the wings are exhibited by many <i>Lepidoptera</i>; thus in
<i>Attacus Atlas</i>, &amp;c., the primary wings are falcated or
hooked at their apex<a name="FNanchor_1949_1949" id="FNanchor_1949_1949"></a><a href="#Footnote_1949_1949" class="fnanchor">[1949]</a>; and in great numbers both wings
are there scolloped into alternate bays and capes, if I
may so speak, varying in depth and length<a name="FNanchor_1950_1950" id="FNanchor_1950_1950"></a><a href="#Footnote_1950_1950" class="fnanchor">[1950]</a>. There is
usually a sinus between every pair of nervures, each of
which terminates in the adjoining prominence, as a fold
does in the sinus<a name="FNanchor_1951_1951" id="FNanchor_1951_1951"></a><a href="#Footnote_1951_1951" class="fnanchor">[1951]</a>. Where present, in the <i>primary</i> wings
there are <i>eight</i> of these sinuses, and in the <i>secondary</i>,
where they are most usual, <i>seven</i>; some are remarkable
for the long <i>tails</i> which distinguish their secondary wings;
those in <i>Papilio</i> are usually an elongation of the fifth, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
the anterior margin, of the prominences before mentioned,
into a spathula-shaped diverging process, varying in
length and width<a name="FNanchor_1952_1952" id="FNanchor_1952_1952"></a><a href="#Footnote_1952_1952" class="fnanchor">[1952]</a>: but in <i>P. Ulysses</i> it does not diverge;
and in <i>P. Podalirius</i> it is linear. They are found also in
other subgenera; thus in <i>Urania Patroclus</i> there are <i>two</i>;
in <i>U. RiphÃ¦us</i> <i>three</i>; in <i>Erycina Cupido</i> <i>five</i>; and in
<i>E. Endymion</i> <i>six</i> of these tails; in some, as in <i>E. Dorylas</i>,
the whole wing seems to form the tail; in others again, as
in <i>Hesperia Proteus</i> and <i>Bombyx Luna</i>, it is an elongation
of the anal angle. Other wings in this Order are divided
into lobes resembling feathers, as you may see in <i>Pterophorus
hexadactylus</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1953_1953" id="FNanchor_1953_1953"></a><a href="#Footnote_1953_1953" class="fnanchor">[1953]</a></p>

<p>6. We are next to consider the <i>clothing</i> of wings: these,
in the Orders in which they are covered by elytra, tegmina,
or hemelytra, are generally naked, except that the
spots in those of <i>Fulgora laternaria</i>, <i>serrata</i>, &amp;c., and the
whole wing in <i>Flata</i>, <i>Aleyrodes</i>, and others, are covered
with a kind of farinaceous powder; but in all the remaining
Orders, hairs or scales are more or less implanted in
these organs: as the <i>Lepidoptera</i> are the most remarkable
for the clothing of their wings, I shall leave them till
the last, and begin with the <i>Neuroptera</i>. If you lightly
pass your finger over the wing of any dragon-fly (<i>Libellula</i>
F., <i>Ãshna</i> F.), from the apex towards the base, you
will find that the longitudinal nervures are, as it were,
serrulated with very minute bristles, which point towards
the extremity; if you next move the finger across the
wing, from the posterior to the anterior margin, a similar
circumstance will strike you. M. Chabrier conjectures
that, amongst other uses<a name="FNanchor_1954_1954" id="FNanchor_1954_1954"></a><a href="#Footnote_1954_1954" class="fnanchor">[1954]</a>, these hairs may contribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
to fix the atmospheric fluid when the wings are
depressed in flight, while it glides over them as they
rise<a name="FNanchor_1955_1955" id="FNanchor_1955_1955"></a><a href="#Footnote_1955_1955" class="fnanchor">[1955]</a>; in <i>Ascalaphus</i>, <i>Myrmeleon</i>, <i>Nemoptera</i>, <i>Hemerobius</i>,
&amp;c., the nervures are more visibly bristled; the
bristles diverging on each side from the longitudinal ones,
but all pointing towards the apex from the connecting or
transverse ones; in <i>Panorpa</i>, besides these bristles, short
hairs, pointing the same way, are thickly planted in the
membrane of the wing; and in <i>Hemerobius</i> the margins
of the wing are fringed; in the <i>Ephemerina</i>, <i>Corydalis</i>,
&amp;c., the wings are naked. In the <i>Trichoptera</i> Order, as
their name imports, they are covered with minute decumbent
hairs, less easily seen but still existing in the secondary
pair. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> in general the wings
are covered with minute hairs or bristles; but in <i>Tiphia</i>,
<i>Scolia</i>&mdash;with the exception of <i>S. Radula</i> and affinities in
which they are hairy&mdash;and others, the wings are nearly
naked; in <i>Pompilus</i>, <i>Pepsis</i>, &amp;c., the hairs are infinitely
numerous and very short; in the <i>SphecidÃ¦</i>, <i>Mutilla</i>,
&amp;c., they are more distinct, longer, and less numerous;
in the humble-bee (<i>Bombus</i>) and many others the apex
of the wing is darkened by a large number of more conspicuous
hairs, each of which seems to spring from a minute
tubercle: as these tubercles are in a part of the wing
that is strengthened by few nervures, they may probably
be intended to supply their place, in giving firmness and
tension to this part. The wings of <i>Diptera</i>, under the
present head, may be viewed with regard to the hairs
that are implanted in the <i>membrane</i> of the wing, in its
<i>nervures</i>, and in its <i>margin</i>. In the first view, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
<i>Stratyomis</i> and immediate affinities the wing is nearly naked;
but in <i>Xylophagus</i>, <i>Beris</i>, and the great majority of the Order,
the membrane of the wings is thickly planted with innumerable
very minute bristles, not to be seen but under
a powerful lens, often black, and seemingly crowning a
little prominence, and giving the wing an appearance of
the finest net-work. As to the clothing of the nervures,
the costal, in <i>Anthrax</i>, <i>Bombylius</i>, &amp;c., is often remarkably
bristly at the base, with hairs intermixed; in <i>&#338;strus
Ovis</i>, in the inner margin or edge of this nervure, is a
single series of bristles, or rather short spines, like so
many black points; in <i>&#338;. Equi</i> the whole <i>costa</i> is covered
with short decumbent hairs or bristles; in <i>Musca
pagana</i> F., just at the apex of the costal areolet, that nervure
is armed with a spur or diverging bristle larger
than the rest, which is also to be found in many others
of the <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, some of which have two and others more
of these spurs. The little moth-like midges (<i>Psychoda</i>
Latr., <i>HirtÃ¦a</i> F.) at first appear to have the whole surface
of their wings covered with hairs; but upon a closer
examination it will be seen that they are planted in the
nervures, from each of which they diverge, so as under
a lens to give it a very elegant appearance<a name="FNanchor_1956_1956" id="FNanchor_1956_1956"></a><a href="#Footnote_1956_1956" class="fnanchor">[1956]</a>. This fly
has its wings beautifully fringed with fine hairs, the
<i>third</i> circumstance to be attended to under this head; in
the Tipulidans, and many others of this Order, the apex
and posterior margin are also finely fringed with short
hairs. Some Dipterous insects make a near approach
to the <i>Lepidoptera</i> in the <i>covering</i> of their wings: in the
common gnat, when the wings are not rubbed, the nervures
are adorned by a double series of <i>scales</i>, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
marginal fringe also consists of them<a name="FNanchor_1957_1957" id="FNanchor_1957_1957"></a><a href="#Footnote_1957_1957" class="fnanchor">[1957]</a>; and in a Georgian
genus, which appears in some degree to connect <i>Culex</i>
with <i>Anthrax</i> &amp;c., there are scales scattered upon the
membrane as well as upon the nervures; besides, its antennÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_1958_1958" id="FNanchor_1958_1958"></a><a href="#Footnote_1958_1958" class="fnanchor">[1958]</a>
and abdomen are also covered with them.</p>

<p>The Order, the clothing of whose organs of flight
excites the admiration of the most incurious beholder, is
that to which the excursive butterfly belongs, the <i>Lepidoptera</i>.
The gorgeous wings of these universal favourites,
as well as those of the hawk-moths and moths, owe
all their beauty, not to the <i>substance</i> of which they are
composed, but to an infinite number of little <i>plumes</i> or
<i>scales</i> so thickly planted in their upper and under surface,
as in the great majority entirely to conceal that
substance. Whether these are really most analogous to
plumes or scales has been thought doubtful. De Geer
is inclined to think, from their terminating at their
lower end in little quills and other circumstances, that
they resemble <i>feathers</i> as much as scales<a name="FNanchor_1959_1959" id="FNanchor_1959_1959"></a><a href="#Footnote_1959_1959" class="fnanchor">[1959]</a>; Reaumur on
the contrary suspects that they come nearer to <i>scales</i><a name="FNanchor_1960_1960" id="FNanchor_1960_1960"></a><a href="#Footnote_1960_1960" class="fnanchor">[1960]</a>.
Their substance, approaching to membrane, seems to
make further for the former opinion, and their shape and
the indentations that often occur in their extremity, furnish
an additional argument for the latter. Their numbers
are infinite; Leeuwenhoek found more than 400,000
on the wings of the silk-worm moth (<i>Bombyx Mori</i>)<a name="FNanchor_1961_1961" id="FNanchor_1961_1961"></a><a href="#Footnote_1961_1961" class="fnanchor">[1961]</a>;
and in those of some of the larger moths and butterflies
the number must greatly exceed this. You will observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
however that in many <i>Lepidoptera</i> the wings are <i>partially</i>,
and in some instances <i>generally</i>, transparent: thus in
<i>Hesperia Proteus</i>, a butterfly before noticed for the long
tail that distinguishes its secondary wings, there are many
transparent spots; in <i>Attacus Atlas</i>, one of the largest
of moths, and its affinities, there is as it were a <i>window</i>
in each wing formed by a transparent triangular space;
in <i>A. Polyphemus</i>, <i>Paphia</i>, &amp;c., the pupil of the ocellus is
transparent, which in the former is divided by a nervure.
In several of the Heliconian butterflies, and in
<i>ZygÃ¦na</i> F., &amp;c., the greater part of both wings is transparent,
with scales only upon their nervures, round their
margin, or forming certain bands or spots upon them;
in <i>Parnassius Apollo</i>, <i>Mnemosyne</i>, &amp;c., the scales are so
arranged as not wholly to cover the wings, which renders
them semidiaphanous; and in some (<i>Nudaria</i>) the wings
are intirely denuded. With regard to <i>size</i>, the scales vary
often considerably in different tribes; in <i>Heliconia</i> they
appear to be more minute than in the rest; and in <i>Castnia</i>
they are the largest and coarsest; the extremity of the
wings of Lepidopterous insects in general is fringed with
longer scales than their surfaces, and even those of the last
in the same wing; sometimes vary in magnitude. The little
seeming tooth that projects from the middle of the posterior
margin in the upper wings of <i>Notodonta</i>, a subgenus
of <i>Bombyx</i> L., is merely produced by some longer diverging
hairs. The <i>shape</i> and <i>figure</i> also of scales are
very various&mdash;some being long and slender; others short
and broad; some nearly round; others oval, ovate, or
oblong; others spathulate; others panduriform or parabolical;
some again almost square or rhomboidal; many
triangular; some representing an isosceles triangle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>
others an equilateral one; lastly, some are lanceolate and
others linear; again, some have a very short pedicle and
others a very long one: with regard to their <i>extremity</i>;
some are intire, without projecting points or incisions,
while others are furnished with them: of these some terminate
in a single long mucro, others have several shorter
ones; some are armed with teeth, varying in number
from two to thirteen in different species<a name="FNanchor_1962_1962" id="FNanchor_1962_1962"></a><a href="#Footnote_1962_1962" class="fnanchor">[1962]</a>. Many other
forms might be enumerated, but these are sufficient to
give you a general notion of the infinite variety of this
part of the works of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>. I must next say a
word or two upon their <i>arrangement</i> on the wing. In
most instances this is in transverse lines, which sometimes
vary a little from a rectilinear course, and the extremity
of the scales of one row reposes on the base of
those of the succeeding one, so that in this respect their
arrangement is like that of tiles in a roof: in some cases
it is not so regular: thus the minute scales on the
wings of <i>Parnassius Apollo</i>, and others with subdiaphanous
wings, are arranged without order; in <i>Pieris</i> and
other Diurnal <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and many of the Crepuscular
and Nocturnal, there appears to be a <i>double</i> layer of
scales on both sides of the wing; the under layer usually
consisting of <i>white</i> ones. If you denude the wings of any
butterfly, which you may easily do by scraping it lightly
on both sides with a penknife, you will be amused to
trace the lines in which the scales were planted, consisting
of innumerable minute dots: the lines of the under
side, in some cases, so cut those of the upper side, as by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
their intersection to form lozenges. With regard to the
position of the scales on the wing, they usually lie flat,
but sometimes their extremity is incurved: in the beautiful
<i>Argynnis VanillÃ¦</i> a very singular appearance of numerous
transverse ridges is produced by the extremity
of those scales that cover the longitudinal nervures of
the primary wings, except at the base, being recurved.</p>

<p>But though the general clothing of the wings of <i>Lepidoptera</i>
consists of these little scales, yet in some cases
they are either replaced by <i>hairs</i> or mixed with them.
Thus, in the <i>clear</i> parts of the wings of Heliconians, <i>Attaci</i>,
&amp;c., short inconspicuous hairs are planted; in a
large number of the Orders the <i>upper</i> side of the Anal
Area of the secondary wings is hairy; in several Crepusculars
(<i>Sphinx Ph&#339;nix</i>, &amp;c.), where there is a double layer
as before mentioned, the upper one consists of dense
hairs, except at the apex, and the lower one of scales;
and in most of them the scales of the primary wings are
piliform, and the secondary are covered by what approach
very near to real hairs; many of the <i>Attaci</i> are
similarly circumstanced: the four wings of <i>A. Cytherea</i>
are also covered externally with hair.</p>

<p>7. Before I conclude this long diatribe on the organs of
flight of insects, I must not omit some notice of the infinite
diversity of <i>colours</i> with which their wings are often
variegated and adorned by the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, who loves to
delight us by the beauty, as well as to astonish and awe
us by the immensity and grandeur of his works. Though
the wings in every Order exhibit instances of brilliant
and beautiful colouring, yet those of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> in
this respect infinitely excel them all, and to these, under
this head, after noticing a few in the less privileged Orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>
my observations will be confined. Although in the
<i>Coleoptera</i> the wings are seldom distinguished by their
splendour; yet those of some <i>CetoniadÃ¦</i>, as <i>Cetonia
africana</i>, are extremely brilliant, and resemble those of
many <i>XylocopÃ¦</i> in the lovely violet hue that adorns them:
amongst the <i>Orthoptera</i> some <i>PterophyllÃ¦</i>, and in the
Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i> some <i>FulgorÃ¦</i>, emulate the <i>Lepidoptera</i>
in the <i>ocelli</i> that give a kind of life to these
organs<a name="FNanchor_1963_1963" id="FNanchor_1963_1963"></a><a href="#Footnote_1963_1963" class="fnanchor">[1963]</a>; and a vast number of the destructive tribe of
locusts (<i>Locusta</i> Leach) are remarkable for the fine
colours and gaiety of their wings<a name="FNanchor_1964_1964" id="FNanchor_1964_1964"></a><a href="#Footnote_1964_1964" class="fnanchor">[1964]</a>; in the <i>Neuroptera</i> numerous
<i>LibellulinÃ¦</i> emulate the Heliconian butterflies by
their maculation; and in the genus <i>Ascalaphus</i>, which
represents the <i>Lepidoptera</i> by its clubbed antennÃ¦<a name="FNanchor_1965_1965" id="FNanchor_1965_1965"></a><a href="#Footnote_1965_1965" class="fnanchor">[1965]</a>, many
also have the resemblance increased by the painting of
their wings, so that some Entomologists have actually
considered some of them as belonging to that Order<a name="FNanchor_1966_1966" id="FNanchor_1966_1966"></a><a href="#Footnote_1966_1966" class="fnanchor">[1966]</a>;
the wings of the <i>XylocopÃ¦</i>, before alluded to, sometimes
add to the deep tints of the violet&mdash;which also prevail in
the wings of several <i>Diptera</i>&mdash;towards their extremity
the most brilliant metallic green or copper varying,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As the site varies in the gazer's hand,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and even those wings that consist of clear colourless
membrane are often rendered extremely beautiful from the
reflection of the prismatic colours. I should undertake an
endless task did I attempt to specify all the modes of marking,
clouding, and spotting, that variegate a wing, and all
the shades of colour that paint it, amongst the Lepidopterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
tribes; I shall therefore confine myself to a few of the
principal, especially those that distinguish particular tribes
and families. Of whole coloured wings&mdash;I know none that
dazzle the eye of the beholder so much as the upper surface
of those of <i>Morpho Menelaus</i> and <i>Telemachus</i>: LinnÃ©
justly observes that there is scarcely any thing in nature
that for brightness and splendour can be paralleled with
this colour; it is a kind of rich ultramarine that vies with
the deepest and purest azure of the sky; and what must
cause a striking contrast in flight, the prone surface of
the wings is as dull and dark as the supine is brilliant,
so that one can conceive this animal to appear like a
planet in full radiance, and under eclipse, as its wings
open and shut in the blaze of a tropical sun: another
butterfly, <i>Papilio Ulysses</i>, by its radiating cerulean disk,
surrounded on every side by a margin intensely black,
gives the idea of light first emerging from primeval obscurity;
it was probably this idea of light shining in darkness
that induced LinnÃ© to give it the name of the wisest
of the Greeks in a dark and barbarous age. I know no
insect upon which the sight rests with such untired pleasure,
as upon the lovely butterfly that bears the name of
the unhappy Trojan king (<i>P. Priamus</i>); the contrast of
the rich green and black of the velvet of its wings with
each other, and with the orange of its abdomen, is beyond
expression regal and magnificent. But peculiar beauties
of colour sometimes distinguish whole <i>tribes</i> as well as
<i>individuals</i>. What can be more lovely than that tribe
of little butterflies that flit around us every where in
our summer rambles, which are called <i>blues</i>, and which
exhibit the various tints of the sky? <i>LycÃ¦na Adonis</i> of
this tribe scarcely yields to any exotic butterfly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>
celestial purity of its azure wings: our native <i>coppers</i> also,
<i>LycÃ¦na dispar</i><a name="FNanchor_1967_1967" id="FNanchor_1967_1967"></a><a href="#Footnote_1967_1967" class="fnanchor">[1967]</a>, <i>VirgaureÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., are remarkable for
the fulgid colour of these organs; in <i>Argynnis</i> the upper
side of their wings is tawny, spotted with black, while the
under side of the secondary ones is very often adorned by
the appearance of <i>silver</i> spots. How this remarkable effect
of metallic lustre, so often reflected by spots in the wings
of butterflies, is produced, seems not to have occupied
the attention of Entomologists. M. Audebert is of opinion
that the similar lustre of the plumes of the humming
birds (<i>Trochilus</i>) is owing to their density, to the polish
of their surface, and to the great number of little minute
concave mirrors which are observable on their little
beards<a name="FNanchor_1968_1968" id="FNanchor_1968_1968"></a><a href="#Footnote_1968_1968" class="fnanchor">[1968]</a>. But these observations will not apply to the
scales of the wings of butterflies, which are always very
thin and generally very flat: in some instances, as in
<i>Morpho Menelaus</i>, there appears more than one very slight
channel upon a scale; but this takes place also in others
that reflect no lustre. Their metallic hues must therefore
principally be occasioned by the high polish of their
surface and the richness of their tints. It is the purity
of the white, in conjunction with their shining surface,
contrasted with the dull opaque colour of the under side
of the secondary wings, that causes the spots that decorate
those of the Fritillaries (<i>Argynnis</i>) to emulate the lustre
of silver. In <i>Papilio</i> the Trojans are distinguished by
the black wings with sanguine spots, and the Greeks by
the same with yellow spots; but these have proved in
some instances only sexual distinctions<a name="FNanchor_1969_1969" id="FNanchor_1969_1969"></a><a href="#Footnote_1969_1969" class="fnanchor">[1969]</a>. In the <i>Danai
candidi</i> L. the colour of the tribe may be described as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>
sacred to the <i>day</i>, since every shade, from white or the
palest yellow to full orange, is exhibited by them. The
yellows prevail also in those <i>NoctuÃ¦</i>, the trivial names of
which LinnÃ© made to end in <i>ago</i>, as <i>N. Fulvago</i>, <i>Citrago</i>,
&amp;c. I must not conclude this part of my subject without
noticing one of the most striking ornaments of the
wings of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the many-coloured <i>eyes</i> which decorate
so large a number of them. Some few birds, as
the Peacock and Argus Pheasant, have been decked by
their <span class="smcap">Creator</span> very conspicuously with this almost
dazzling glory; but in the insects just named it meets us
every where. Some, as one of our most beautiful butterflies,
<i>Vanessa Io</i><a name="FNanchor_1970_1970" id="FNanchor_1970_1970"></a><a href="#Footnote_1970_1970" class="fnanchor">[1970]</a>, have them both on the primary and
secondary wings; others, as <i>Noctua Bubo</i><a name="FNanchor_1971_1971" id="FNanchor_1971_1971"></a><a href="#Footnote_1971_1971" class="fnanchor">[1971]</a>, only on the
primary; others again, as <i>Smerinthus ocellata</i><a name="FNanchor_1972_1972" id="FNanchor_1972_1972"></a><a href="#Footnote_1972_1972" class="fnanchor">[1972]</a>, only on
the secondary: in some also they are on both sides of the
wing, as in <i>Hipparchia Ãgeria</i><a name="FNanchor_1973_1973" id="FNanchor_1973_1973"></a><a href="#Footnote_1973_1973" class="fnanchor">[1973]</a>, and in others only on
the upper side, as in <i>Vanessa Io</i>; in others again only on
the under side, as in <i>Morpho Teucer</i><a name="FNanchor_1974_1974" id="FNanchor_1974_1974"></a><a href="#Footnote_1974_1974" class="fnanchor">[1974]</a>: in some likewise
they are very large, as in the secondary wings of the same
butterfly: and in others very small, as in those in the
wings of the blues (<i>LycÃ¦na</i>). Once more, in some they
consist only of <i>iris</i> and <i>pupil</i>, as in <i>Hipparchia Semele</i>,
and in others of many concentric circles besides, as in
<i>Morpho Teucer</i>, &amp;c.</p>


<p>v. <i>Legs</i><a name="FNanchor_1975_1975" id="FNanchor_1975_1975"></a><a href="#Footnote_1975_1975" class="fnanchor">[1975]</a>. We are next to consider those organs of
motion affixed to the trunk, by which insects transport
themselves from one place to another on the earth or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
the water, and by which also they perform various operations
connected with their economy<a name="FNanchor_1976_1976" id="FNanchor_1976_1976"></a><a href="#Footnote_1976_1976" class="fnanchor">[1976]</a>. In treating of
them we should consider their <i>number</i>; <i>kind</i>; <i>substance</i>;
<i>articulation</i> with the <i>trunk</i>; <i>position</i>; <i>proportions</i>; <i>clothing</i>;
<i>composition</i>; <i>folding</i>; and <i>motions</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Number.</i> Having before very fully explained to you
the number and kind of the legs of insects in their <i>preparatory</i>
states<a name="FNanchor_1977_1977" id="FNanchor_1977_1977"></a><a href="#Footnote_1977_1977" class="fnanchor">[1977]</a>, I shall now confine myself to the consideration
of these organs in their <i>perfect</i> or last state;
beginning with their <i>number</i>. Insects, properly so called,
as I formerly observed<a name="FNanchor_1978_1978" id="FNanchor_1978_1978"></a><a href="#Footnote_1978_1978" class="fnanchor">[1978]</a>, in this state, including the
anterior pair or arms, have only <i>six</i> legs, none exceeding
or falling short of this number; but in several of the
Diurnal <i>Lepidoptera</i> (<i>Vanessa</i>, &amp;c.) the anterior pair
are <i>spurious</i>, or at least not used as legs, the tarsi having
neither joints nor claws<a name="FNanchor_1979_1979" id="FNanchor_1979_1979"></a><a href="#Footnote_1979_1979" class="fnanchor">[1979]</a>; this in some cases is said to be
only a <i>sexual</i> distinction<a name="FNanchor_1980_1980" id="FNanchor_1980_1980"></a><a href="#Footnote_1980_1980" class="fnanchor">[1980]</a>. In <i>Onitis</i>, <i>PhanÃ¦us</i>, and some
other <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> M<sup>c</sup>L., the arm has either none or a spurious
tarsus or <i>manus</i><a name="FNanchor_1981_1981" id="FNanchor_1981_1981"></a><a href="#Footnote_1981_1981" class="fnanchor">[1981]</a>; which in the first of these genera
is also a sexual character. From both these instances
we see that walking is only a <i>secondary</i> use of forelegs
in the insect tribes. Besides insects proper, a whole
tribe of mites (<i>Caris</i> Latr., <i>Leptus</i> Latr., <i>Astoma</i> Latr.,
<i>Ocypete</i> Leach) have only <i>six</i> legs; the rest, and the
<i>Arachnida</i> in general, have <i>eight</i>; in the <i>Myriapods</i>,
<i>Pollyxenus</i> has <i>twelve pairs</i>; <i>Scutigera</i> has <i>fifteen</i>; the
terrestrial <i>Glomerides</i> (<i>G. Armadillo</i>, &amp;c.) <i>sixteen</i>; and
the oceanic (<i>G. ovalis</i>) <i>twenty</i>; the oriental <i>ScolopendrÃ¦</i>
Leach, <i>twenty-one</i>; <i>Polydesmus</i> has usually about <i>thirty</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>
<i>pairs</i>; <i>Craspedosoma</i>, <i>fifty</i>; <i>Geophilus electricus</i> at least
<i>sixty</i>; in <i>Iulus terrestris</i> there are more than <i>seventy</i>; in
<i>I. sabulosus</i> nearly <i>one hundred</i>; in <i>I. fuscus</i>, 124; and in
<i>I. maximus</i> 134 pairs or 268 single legs. But with respect
to the <i>Geophili</i>, <i>Iuli</i>, &amp;c., it is to be observed, that the
number of pairs varies in different individuals; and the
circumstance that has been before mentioned<a name="FNanchor_1982_1982" id="FNanchor_1982_1982"></a><a href="#Footnote_1982_1982" class="fnanchor">[1982]</a>, that these
animals keep acquiring legs in their progress to the perfect
state, instead of losing them, renders it difficult to
ascertain what is the natural number of pairs in any
species.</p>

<p>2. <i>Kinds.</i> Upon a former occasion I gave you a sufficiently
full account of the <i>kinds</i> of legs<a href="#Footnote_1982_1982" class="fnanchor">[1982]</a>, and I have also
assigned my reasons for giving a different denomination
to the <i>anterior</i> legs under certain circumstances<a name="FNanchor_1983_1983" id="FNanchor_1983_1983"></a><a href="#Footnote_1983_1983" class="fnanchor">[1983]</a>; I
shall not therefore enlarge further upon this head.</p>

<p>3. <i>Substance.</i> The <i>substance</i> of the legs is generally
regulated more or less by that of the rest of the body,
only in soft-bodied insects they seem usually more firm
and unbending. Each joint is a tube, including the moving
muscles, nerves, and air vessels.</p>

<p>4. <i>Articulation with the Trunk.</i> M. Cuvier has observed
that the hip (<i>coxa</i>), which is the joint that unites
the leg with the body, rather inosculates, in its acetabulum,
than articulates in any precise manner<a name="FNanchor_1984_1984" id="FNanchor_1984_1984"></a><a href="#Footnote_1984_1984" class="fnanchor">[1984]</a>; but this
observation, though true of a great many, will not apply
universally, for the legs of <i>Orthopterous</i> insects, and of
most of the subsequent Orders, are <i>suspended</i> rather than
inosculating. Even in many <i>Coleoptera</i> a difference is observable
in this respect. I have before mentioned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>
what are called the <i>puncta ordinaria</i>, which distinguish the
sides of the <i>prothorax</i> of many <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> and <i>GeotrupidÃ¦</i>,
form a base for an elevation of the interior surface
with which the extremity of the base of the clavicle,
which plunges deep into the breast, ginglymates<a name="FNanchor_1985_1985" id="FNanchor_1985_1985"></a><a href="#Footnote_1985_1985" class="fnanchor">[1985]</a>; this
structure may also be found in other Lamellicorns, as
the stag-beetle (<i>Lucanus</i>) and <i>Dynastes</i>, that have not
those excavations; in these last it is an elevated ridge
forming a segment of a circle with, it should seem, a posterior
channel, receiving a corresponding cavity and protuberance
of the clavicle. With regard to the mid-leg,
in <i>Copris</i>, the <i>coxa</i> is emboxed in a nearly longitudinal
cavity of the <i>medipectus</i>, and the <i>coxa</i> of the hind-leg anteriorly
is suspended to a transverse cavity of the <i>postpectus</i>,
but posteriorly it is received by a cavity of the
first segment of the abdomen; so that it may be regarded
as suspended anteriorly, and inosculating posteriorly.</p>

<p>In some tribes of this Order, as the Weevils (<i>Curculio</i>
L.) and Capricorns (<i>Cerambyx</i>), the coxÃ¦ of the four anterior
legs are subglobose<a name="FNanchor_1986_1986" id="FNanchor_1986_1986"></a><a href="#Footnote_1986_1986" class="fnanchor">[1986]</a> and extremely lubricous, and
are received each by a socket that fits it, and is equally
lubricous. In the bottom of this externally, and in the
head of the coxa, is an orifice for the transmission of
muscles, nerves, and bronchiÃ¦; but the coxa is suspended
by ligament in the socket. This structure approaches
as near the ball and socket as the nature of the
insect skeleton will permit; the high polish of the articulations
acts the part of <i>synovia</i>, and the motion is in
some degree rotatory or versatile, whereas in <i>Copris</i>, &amp;c.,
lately mentioned, it seems to be more limited, and is probably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>
at least in the mid- and hind-legs, only in two directions;
in the middle pair, probably, from the <i>coxÃ¦</i>
being in a position parallel with the breast, opposite to
that of the hind pair. In <i>Dytiscus</i> L., <i>Carabus</i> L., and
some other beetles, the coxÃ¦, especially the posterior pair,
appear to be fixed and incapable of motion. In many
insects these coxÃ¦ seem to belong as much to the abdomen
as to the trunk. We have just seen this to be the
case in <i>Copris</i>, &amp;c.; and in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, if the former
be separated from the latter, the legs will be detached
with it.</p>

<p>4. <i>Location.</i> We are now to consider the <i>location</i> and
<i>position</i> of the legs, both in general and with respect to
each other. And first, as has been before stated, we may
observe that, in the hexapods with wings, the <i>arms</i> belong
to the <i>manitrunk</i>, and are attached to the <i>antepectus</i> on
each side the <i>prosternum</i>; and the two pair of <i>legs</i> to
the <i>alitrunk</i>, the <i>mid-legs</i> being attached to the <i>medipectus</i>,
between the <i>scapularia</i> and <i>mesosternum</i>; and the
<i>hind-legs</i> to the <i>postpectus</i>, between the <i>parapleura</i> and
the <i>posternum</i>; and further, that the <i>arms</i> are opposed
to the <i>prothorax</i>: the <i>mid-legs</i> to the <i>mesothorax</i> and the
<i>primary</i> organs of flight; and the <i>hind-legs</i> to the <i>metathorax</i>
and the <i>secondary</i> organs of flight; though in
some cases the wings appear to be <i>behind</i> the legs and
in others <i>before</i> them: thus, in <i>Panorpa</i>, the former are
nearer the head than the latter; but in the <i>Libellulina</i> the
reverse of this takes place, the legs being much nearer
the head than the wings: in both cases, however, the
<i>scapularia</i> and <i>parapleurÃ¦</i> run from the legs to the
wings, but in an oblique direction; and in <i>Panorpa</i> these
pieces assume the appearance of articulations of the legs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
In most of the <i>apterous</i> hexapods they appear to be
attached laterally between the <i>thorax</i> and the <i>pectus</i><a name="FNanchor_1987_1987" id="FNanchor_1987_1987"></a><a href="#Footnote_1987_1987" class="fnanchor">[1987]</a>;
but in the flea (<i>Pulex</i>) they are <i>ventral</i>. In this tribe the
arms are usually stated to be inserted in the <i>head</i><a name="FNanchor_1988_1988" id="FNanchor_1988_1988"></a><a href="#Footnote_1988_1988" class="fnanchor">[1988]</a>: but
I once succeeded in separating the head of a flea from the
trunk, and these organs remained attached to the latter<a name="FNanchor_1989_1989" id="FNanchor_1989_1989"></a><a href="#Footnote_1989_1989" class="fnanchor">[1989]</a>.
As to the <i>Octopods</i> and <i>ArachnidÃ¦</i>, in the mites (<i>Acarus</i> L.)
they are lateral, and in their analogues, the spiders
(<i>Aranea</i> L.), they emerge between the thorax and the
breast, which last they nearly surround; in the <i>PhalangidÃ¦</i>
the bases of the coxÃ¦ approach near to each other,
being separated only by a narrow <i>sternum</i>; in their antagonists,
<i>Chelifer</i> and <i>Scorpio</i>, they apply to each other,
the anterior ones acting as <i>maxillÃ¦</i>. In the <i>myriapods</i>
the legs of the <i>Chilopoda</i> Latr., and some <i>Chilognatha</i>,
as <i>Glomeris</i>, are inserted laterally, a single pair in a segment;
but in <i>Iulus</i> L. their attachment is ventral, the
coxÃ¦ seem to spring from a common base, and there are
two pair to each segment<a name="FNanchor_1990_1990" id="FNanchor_1990_1990"></a><a href="#Footnote_1990_1990" class="fnanchor">[1990]</a>, except the three first, which
bear each a single pair.</p>

<p>I shall next consider how the legs are located with respect
to each other. To render this clear to you I shall
represent each of the variations, which amount in all to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
twelve in the hexapods that have fallen under my notice,
by six dots.</p>

<p>1. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671a.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> In this arrangement the legs are all planted
near to each other, there being little or no interval between
the pairs, and between the legs of each pair. It
is exemplified in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Blatta</i>, and many
<i>Diptera</i>.</p>

<p>2. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671b.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Similar to the preceding, but the anterior pair
are distant from the two posterior; exemplified in the
bees (<i>Apis</i>) and most <i>Hymenoptera</i>; <i>Chironomus</i>; <i>Scutellera</i>;
<i>Pachysoma</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_1991_1991" id="FNanchor_1991_1991"></a><a href="#Footnote_1991_1991" class="fnanchor">[1991]</a></p>

<p>3. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671c.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Like the last, but the posterior pair is distant
from the two anterior. <i>Examples</i>: <i>Silpha</i>, <i>Necrophorus</i>,
<i>Telephorus</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671d.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Similar to the last, but the legs of the posterior
pair are more distant from each other than the four anterior.
<i>Ex. Curculio</i> L.</p>

<p>5. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671e.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> The legs of each pair near each other, but the
pairs distant. <i>Ex. Gibbium.</i></p>

<p>6. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671f.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Both the legs of each pair and the pairs distant.
<i>Ex. Blaps</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>7. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671g.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Anterior pair distant from the two posterior,
and the legs of the middle pair rather more distant
from each other than those of the other pairs. <i>Ex. ScarabÃ¦us</i>
M<sup>c</sup>L.</p>

<p>8. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671h.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Like the preceding, only the legs of the middle
pair are at a much greater distance from each other.
<i>Ex. Copris</i> M<sup>c</sup>L.</p>

<p>9. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671i.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Legs of the two posterior pairs distant. <i>Ex.
Hister</i>, <i>Scaphidium</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span></p>
<p>10. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_672a.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Like the preceding, but the posterior legs
more distant than those of the middle pair. <i>Ex. LygÃ¦us.</i></p>

<p>11. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671b.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> Like the last, but the legs of the anterior
pair also distant. <i>Ex. Velia.</i></p>

<p>12. <span style="vertical-align: -35%"><img src="images/i_671c.png" alt="eye shape" /></span> The arms distant, intermediate legs more distant,
posterior legs close together. <i>Ex. Byrrhus</i> L.</p>

<p>5. <i>Proportions.</i> In general the legs of some insects
are disproportionally <i>long</i> and <i>slender</i>, as in <i>Phalangium
Opilio</i> and some species of <i>Gonyleptes</i><a name="FNanchor_1992_1992" id="FNanchor_1992_1992"></a><a href="#Footnote_1992_1992" class="fnanchor">[1992]</a>: those
of others are disproportionally <i>short</i>, as in <i>Elater</i>, &amp;c.
With regard to their relative proportions, the most general
rule is, in Hexapods, that the anterior pair shall
be the shortest and most slender, and the posterior the
longest and thickest; but there are many exceptions:
thus, in <i>Macropus longimanus</i>, <i>Clytra longimana</i>, &amp;c., in
the male the <i>arms</i> are the longest; again, a thing that
very rarely occurs, in the same sex of <i>Podalirius retusa</i>
the <i>intermediate legs</i> are the longest<a name="FNanchor_1993_1993" id="FNanchor_1993_1993"></a><a href="#Footnote_1993_1993" class="fnanchor">[1993]</a>; but in <i>Rhina barbirostris</i>
and many weevils they are the shortest: in <i>Saperda
hirtipes</i> Oliv.<a name="FNanchor_1994_1994" id="FNanchor_1994_1994"></a><a href="#Footnote_1994_1994" class="fnanchor">[1994]</a> the <i>hind-legs</i> are disproportionally
long: with regard to <i>thickness</i>, they are in general extremely
slender in <i>Cicindela</i>, and in the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> very <i>thick</i>.
In <i>Goliathus Cacicus</i> the arms are more robust than the
four legs<a name="FNanchor_1995_1995" id="FNanchor_1995_1995"></a><a href="#Footnote_1995_1995" class="fnanchor">[1995]</a>; in <i>Gyrinus</i> the latter are more dilated than the
former; in many <i>RutelidÃ¦</i>, and particularly in the celebrated
Kanguroo beetle (<i>ScarabÃ¦us Macropus</i> Franc.) the
hind-legs are much the thickest; in a new genus of weevils
from Brazil (<i>Plectropus</i> K.), the intermediate pair are
more slender than either the arms or the posterior pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <i>Clothing.</i> The <i>hairs</i> on the legs of insects, though
at first sight they may seem unimportant, in many cases
are of great use to them, both in their ordinary avocations
and motions: but as most of these were sufficiently noticed
when I treated of the sexes of insects<a name="FNanchor_1996_1996" id="FNanchor_1996_1996"></a><a href="#Footnote_1996_1996" class="fnanchor">[1996]</a>, I shall not
here repeat my observations, but confine myself to cases
not then adverted to. Some insects have all their legs very
hairy, as many spiders, the diamond beetle (<i>Entimus imperialis</i>),
or at least a species very near it and common
in Brazil<a name="FNanchor_1997_1997" id="FNanchor_1997_1997"></a><a href="#Footnote_1997_1997" class="fnanchor">[1997]</a>, &amp;c.: in others they are nearly naked, as in
the stag-beetle. In the Crepuscular <i>Lepidoptera</i> (<i>Sphinx</i>
L.) and some of the Nocturnal ones (<i>Bombyx</i> L.) the
thighs are much more hairy than the rest of the legs:
and in <i>Lucanus</i>, <i>Geotrupes</i>, and many other Lamellicorns,
&amp;c., the anterior ones have a yellow or golden spot at
their base, composed of decumbent hairs, which prevent
them from suffering by the violent friction to which they
are exposed in burrowing. In most Petalocerous beetles
the tibiÃ¦ are set with scattered bristles, and sometimes
the thighs. The Tiger beetles (<i>Cicindela</i>) are similarly
circumstanced: but the bristles, which are white, are generally
arranged in rows. In <i>Dytiscus</i>, <i>Hydrophilus</i>, &amp;c.,
the four posterior tarsi; and in <i>Notonecta</i> the posterior
pair, and also the tibiÃ¦&mdash;are fringed on each side with a
dense series of hairs, which structure assists them in
swimming<a name="FNanchor_1998_1998" id="FNanchor_1998_1998"></a><a href="#Footnote_1998_1998" class="fnanchor">[1998]</a>. The tarsi, especially the anterior pair, in a
certain family of <i>Lamia</i> F. (<i>L. papulosa</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_1999_1999" id="FNanchor_1999_1999"></a><a href="#Footnote_1999_1999" class="fnanchor">[1999]</a>), are similarly
fringed, only the hairs curl inwards; and the <i>hand</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>
in <i>Sphex</i> and <i>Ammophila</i>, but not in <i>PelopÃ¦us</i> and <i>Chlorion</i>,
is fringed externally with long bristles.</p>

<p>7. <i>Composition.</i> With regard to their <i>composition</i>,
both arms and legs generally consist of <i>five</i> pieces, which
Entomologists have denominated&mdash;the <i>coxa</i> or <i>hip</i>&mdash;the
<i>trochanter</i>&mdash;the <i>femur</i> or thigh&mdash;the <i>tibia</i> or shank&mdash;and
the <i>tarsus</i> or foot. Where the structure and use of the
fore-leg is different from that of the four hind-legs, I propose
calling these pieces by names corresponding with
those which anatomists have appropriated to the <i>arm</i> in
the higher vertebrate animals: thus, as you will see in
the table, I call the whole fore-leg the <i>brachium</i> or arm;
and the <i>coxa</i> becomes the <i>clavicula</i> or collar-bone; the
<i>trochanter</i>, the <i>scapula</i> or shoulder-blade; the <i>femur</i>, the
<i>humerus</i> or shoulder; the <i>tibia</i>, the <i>cubitus</i> or arm; the
<i>tarsus</i>, the <i>manus</i> or hand. But let me not lead you to
suppose that the pieces, either in the arms or legs of insects,
which are there named after certain others in vertebrate
animals, precisely correspond with them&mdash;by no
means&mdash;since that is a very doubtful point; and some of
them, as the <i>trochanter</i>, clearly do not. Many gentlemen
skilled in anatomy, as I have before observed<a name="FNanchor_2000_2000" id="FNanchor_2000_2000"></a><a href="#Footnote_2000_2000" class="fnanchor">[2000]</a>, have
thought that what is regarded as the <i>coxa</i> in insects really
represents the <i>femur</i>: but there are considerable difficulties
in the way of this supposition, several of which I then
stated. I shall not however enter further into the subject,
and take the above names; since this application of
them is so general and so well understood, except with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span>
regard to the fore-leg, under certain circumstances, as I
find them. I shall now consider them in the order in
which I have named them.</p>

<p>a. <i>Coxa</i> or <i>Clavicula</i><a name="FNanchor_2001_2001" id="FNanchor_2001_2001"></a><a href="#Footnote_2001_2001" class="fnanchor">[2001]</a>. The <i>coxa</i> is the joint that
connects the leg with the trunk of the insect. With regard
to their <i>shape</i>, the most general form of the four
anterior is more or less that of a truncated cone: in the
<i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>, however, they tend to a pyramidal or four-sided
figure; as do the whole six in the <i>Trichoptera</i>: in
numbers of the weevils and capricorns they are subglobose;
in the Lamellicorns they are mostly oblong, and
not prominent: the posterior pair in the <i>Coleoptera</i> are
generally flat and placed in a transverse position, and more
or less oblong and quadrangular: in <i>Elater</i>, &amp;c., they are
cuneiform: in <i>Haliplus</i> Latr. they are dilated, and cover
the thigh<a name="FNanchor_2002_2002" id="FNanchor_2002_2002"></a><a href="#Footnote_2002_2002" class="fnanchor">[2002]</a>: in <i>Buprestis</i>, <i>Copris</i>, &amp;c., they have a cavity
that partly receives it: the corresponding part, the <i>clavicle</i>,
in the <i>arm</i> of <i>Gryllotalpa</i>, is very large and remarkable;
viewed underneath it is triangular, and trifid
where the trochanter articulates with it: in that of <i>Megachile
Willughbiella</i> the clavicle is armed with a spine<a name="FNanchor_2003_2003" id="FNanchor_2003_2003"></a><a href="#Footnote_2003_2003" class="fnanchor">[2003]</a>.
As to their <i>proportions</i>, the most general law seems to be,
that the anterior pair shall be the shortest and smallest, and
the posterior the longest and largest. In some instances,
as in <i>Buprestis</i>, the two anterior pair are nearly equal;
in others (<i>Mantis</i>, <i>Eurhinus</i> K.), the anterior are the
longest, in the former as long as the thigh, and the four
posterior the shortest: in the <i>Trichoptera</i>, <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
&amp;c., all are nearly equal; in <i>Mantis</i> the two <i>posterior</i>,
and in <i>Phengodes</i> the <i>intermediate</i> pair are the largest; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>
in <i>Necrophorus</i> they are the smallest:&mdash;though almost
universally without articulations, in <i>Galeodes</i> the clavicle
consists of <i>two</i> and the coxa of <i>three</i><a name="FNanchor_2004_2004" id="FNanchor_2004_2004"></a><a href="#Footnote_2004_2004" class="fnanchor">[2004]</a>.</p>

<p>b. <i>Trochanter</i> or <i>Scapula</i><a name="FNanchor_2005_2005" id="FNanchor_2005_2005"></a><a href="#Footnote_2005_2005" class="fnanchor">[2005]</a>. This is the <i>second</i> joint
of the leg: and if the <i>coxa</i> is regarded as the analogue of
the <i>thigh</i> in vertebrate animals, this should seem to represent
the <i>patella</i> or <i>rotula</i>, vulgarly called the knee-pan.
Latreille and Dr. Virey consider this articulation
as merely a joint of the <i>coxa</i><a name="FNanchor_2006_2006" id="FNanchor_2006_2006"></a><a href="#Footnote_2006_2006" class="fnanchor">[2006]</a>; but if closely examined,
especially in Coleopterous insects, you will find
it so fixed to the thigh as scarcely to have separate motion
from it, and in many cases it seems to be merely its
fulcrum; but I am not aware that any instance occurs in
which it has not motion separate from that of the former
joint.</p>

<p>As to its <i>articulation</i> with the <i>coxa</i>,&mdash;in the <i>Coleoptera</i>
it appears to be of a mixed kind; for it inosculates
in that joint, is suspended by ligament to its orifice,
and its protuberances are received by corresponding
cavities in it; and its cavities receive protuberances,
which belongs to a ginglymous articulation. I have
observed two variations in this Order, in one of which
the motion of the thigh and trochanter is only in <i>two</i> directions,
and in the other it is nearly <i>versatile</i> or rotatory.
The <i>Lamellicorns</i> afford an example of the first, and
the <i>Rhyncophorous</i> beetles or weevils of the second. If
you extract from the <i>coxa</i> the thigh with the trochanter
of the larger species of <i>Dynastes</i> M<sup>c</sup>L., you will find that
the head of the latter is divided into two obtuse incurving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
lobes or condyles: that on the inner side being the
smallest and shortest, and constricted just below its apex:
and that under this is a shallow or glenoid cavity, terminating
posteriorly in a lubricous flat curvilinear ridge.
If you next examine the trochanter in articulation with
the coxa, you will perceive that the head of the former
inosculates in it, that the lower condyle is received by a
sinus of the coxa, which also has a lubricous <i>very</i> shallow
cavity corresponding with the ridge, in which it turns;
and in the head of the coxa, on the lower side, is an external
condyle, which is received by a sinus common to
both, of the head of the thigh and of the exterior side of
the trochanter<a name="FNanchor_2007_2007" id="FNanchor_2007_2007"></a><a href="#Footnote_2007_2007" class="fnanchor">[2007]</a>, in which it likewise turns: this last condyle
has also an internal protuberance, which appears to
ginglymate with a cavity of the trochanter: from this
structure the leg is limited chiefly to a motion up and
down upon two pivots, or to fold and extend itself. You
will find an articulation very near this, but on a smaller
scale, in the stag-beetle. In the other kind of articulation,
which admits of freer motion, the head of the trochanter
is prolonged, and the process terminates in a
short interior condyle, which appears to work in a corresponding
cavity of the interior of the coxa; and the
base of the process is encompassed by a ridge with a
cavity behind it, which is received by another of the
lower part of that piece, and admits a corresponding
ridge&mdash;a structure that allows a rotatory motion. In the
hind-legs of this tribe the motion is chiefly limited to
folding and extending; in <i>Carabus</i>, &amp;c., also the head of
the trochanter is nearly hemispherical, and the articulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span>
approaches ball and socket. In most of the other
Orders, the <i>Hymenoptera</i> excepted, there is little or no
inosculation, the trochanter being simply suspended by
ligament to the <i>coxa</i> as well as to the <i>thigh</i>; its connection
with the latter is similar in <i>Coleoptera</i>; but in <i>Cicindela</i>,
&amp;c., it inosculates in it. The part we are considering
varies in its position with respect to the thigh:
in the hind-legs of <i>Carabus</i>, &amp;c., it forms a lateral fulcrum
on the inner side of that part, and does not intervene
between its base and the coxa; the muscles from
the latter entering the former, not at the bottom of the
base, but at its side: but in the four anterior legs it
forms their base, as it does in all the legs in <i>Apion</i>, and
in all the Orders except the <i>Coleoptera</i>, cutting them entirely
off from contact with the coxa: in the <i>Lamellicorns</i>
they cut off part of the base obliquely, but so as to permit
their coming in contact with the condyle of the coxa,
as before mentioned. In the <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i> and some
other <i>Hymenoptera</i> the <i>trochanter</i> appears to consist of
<i>two</i> joints particularly visible in the posterior legs<a name="FNanchor_2008_2008" id="FNanchor_2008_2008"></a><a href="#Footnote_2008_2008" class="fnanchor">[2008]</a>.</p>

<p>As to <i>size</i> in general,&mdash;the part in question is smaller
than the coxa; but in <i>Notonecta</i> it is larger, and in the
dog-tick (<i>Ixodes Ricinus</i>) longer than that joint. It exhibits
few variations in its <i>shape</i> or <i>appendages</i> worthy
of particular notice. In general, in the <i>Coleoptera</i> it is
triangular or trigonal; but in <i>Carabus</i> L., in the hind-leg
it is oblong or rather kidney-shaped; in that of <i>Necrophorus</i><a name="FNanchor_2009_2009" id="FNanchor_2009_2009"></a><a href="#Footnote_2009_2009" class="fnanchor">[2009]</a>
it terminates in one or two teeth or spines,
varying in length in the different species: in the other
Orders it is not remarkable in this respect.</p>

<p>c. <i>Femur</i> or <i>Humerus</i><a name="FNanchor_2010_2010" id="FNanchor_2010_2010"></a><a href="#Footnote_2010_2010" class="fnanchor">[2010]</a>. The <i>femur</i> or thigh is the
<i>third</i>, and usually the largest and most conspicuous joint
of the leg. In the hypothesis before alluded to<a name="FNanchor_2011_2011" id="FNanchor_2011_2011"></a><a href="#Footnote_2011_2011" class="fnanchor">[2011]</a> it is
considered as the analogue of the <i>tibia</i> of vertebrate
animals. With regard to the <i>articulation</i> of this part
with the trochanter, it has been sufficiently explained
under that head, and that with the <i>tibia</i> I shall treat of
when I come to that joint. As to the <i>size</i> of the thighs,
and their relative <i>proportions</i> to each other and to the
remaining joints of the leg, the most general law is, that
the <i>anterior</i> pair shall be the <i>shortest</i> and <i>smallest</i>, and
the <i>posterior</i> the <i>longest</i> and <i>largest</i>. With respect to the
remaining articulations, most commonly the <i>thigh</i> is longer
and larger than the <i>tibia</i>, and the <i>tibia</i> than the <i>tarsus</i>.
But there are numerous exceptions to both these rules.
With respect to the <i>first</i>, we may begin by observing that
the increase of the magnitude of the thigh, from the anterior
to the posterior pair, is usually <i>gradual</i>: but in
many jumping insects, and likewise many that do not
jump, the posterior pair are <i>suddenly</i> and disproportionally
thicker than the rest<a name="FNanchor_2012_2012" id="FNanchor_2012_2012"></a><a href="#Footnote_2012_2012" class="fnanchor">[2012]</a>. Again, in many insects
the <i>anterior</i> pair are the <i>longest</i> and <i>thickest</i>, as in <i>Macropus
longimanus</i>, <i>Bibio</i>, <i>Nabis</i>, &amp;c.: in others, the <i>intermediate</i>
exceed the rest in <i>magnitude</i>, as in <i>Onitis
Aygulus</i>, <i>cupreus</i>; <i>Sicus flavipes</i>, &amp;c.; in many Lamellicorns
<i>all</i> the thighs are incrassated and nearly equal in
size: but in some, as <i>Ryssonotus nebulosus</i> M<sup>c</sup>L.<a name="FNanchor_2013_2013" id="FNanchor_2013_2013"></a><a href="#Footnote_2013_2013" class="fnanchor">[2013]</a>, the
<i>intermediate</i> pair are rather smaller than the rest. With
respect to the <i>second</i> rule&mdash;in some, as in the male of
<i>Macropus longimanus</i>, the <i>anterior tibia</i>, though more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span>
slender, is longer than the <i>thigh</i>; in <i>Hololepta maxillosa</i>
it is longer and more dilated; in <i>Lamia marmorata</i>,
or one related to it from Brazil, the <i>intermediate</i> pair are
longer; in <i>Ateuchus gibbus</i> and others of that tribe the
<i>posterior thighs</i> are smaller than the <i>tibiÃ¦</i>: and, to mention
no more; in <i>Callichroma latipes</i> the <i>posterior</i> tibia
is wider than the part last named. Again, the <i>tarsi</i> are
as long as either <i>tibia</i> or <i>thigh</i> in many of the larger <i>DynastidÃ¦</i>,
as <i>Megasoma ActÃ¦on</i>, &amp;c.; longer than either
in <i>Melolontha subspinosa</i> F.; and in <i>Tiphia</i>, <i>Scolia</i> and
affinities, often as long, or longer than both together.</p>

<p>As to <i>shape</i>,&mdash;the <i>thigh</i>, especially in the fore-leg, varies
considerably: most generally it is flat, linear, and a little
thicker where it is united to the <i>tibia</i>, on the outer
side convex, and concave next the body; but in many it
is gradually thicker from the base to the apex: in some
<i>Cerambyces</i> (<i>C. thoracicus</i>) it is clavate; in others of this
genus and <i>Molorchus</i> they may be called capitate; in
<i>Pterostichus</i> they are rather lanceolate; in <i>Onitis Sphinx</i>
the humerus is triangular, and the intermediate thigh
rhomboidal; in <i>Bruchus Bactris</i> it is bent like a bow;
and in some Brazilian <i>HalticÃ¦</i> it is nearly semicircular.
The <i>humerus</i> in <i>Phasma</i> is attenuated at the base; in
<i>Empusa gongyloides</i> it is at first ovato-lanceolate, and terminates
below in a kind of footstalk<a name="FNanchor_2014_2014" id="FNanchor_2014_2014"></a><a href="#Footnote_2014_2014" class="fnanchor">[2014]</a>; in <i>Phasma flabelliforme</i>
it is dolabriform<a name="FNanchor_2015_2015" id="FNanchor_2015_2015"></a><a href="#Footnote_2015_2015" class="fnanchor">[2015]</a>; in <i>Mantis</i> often semioval
or semielliptical, and thickest at the inner edge, which
affords space for two rows of spines with which it is
planted. In <i>Phyllium siccifolium</i> all the thighs are furnished
on both sides with a foliaceous appendage nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
from base to apex<a name="FNanchor_2016_2016" id="FNanchor_2016_2016"></a><a href="#Footnote_2016_2016" class="fnanchor">[2016]</a>: in a species of <i>Empusa</i> (<i>E. macroptera</i>),
the four posterior ones are so distinguished only
on their posterior side<a name="FNanchor_2017_2017" id="FNanchor_2017_2017"></a><a href="#Footnote_2017_2017" class="fnanchor">[2017]</a>: others of this last genus, as
<i>E. gongyloides</i>, have an alary appendage on <i>both</i> sides
at the apex of these thighs<a name="FNanchor_2018_2018" id="FNanchor_2018_2018"></a><a href="#Footnote_2018_2018" class="fnanchor">[2018]</a>; and another family, as
<i>E. pauperata</i>, have only one on the <i>posterior</i> side<a name="FNanchor_2019_2019" id="FNanchor_2019_2019"></a><a href="#Footnote_2019_2019" class="fnanchor">[2019]</a>. The
thighs of no insect are more remarkable for their elegant
shape,&mdash;tapering gradually from the base to the apex,
where they swell again into a kind of knee,&mdash;than the posterior
ones of the locusts (<i>Locusta</i> Leach); each side of
these thighs is strengthened with three longitudinal nearly
parallel ridges, and the upper and under sides are adorned
by a double series, in some coalescing as they approach
the tibia, of oblique quadrangular elevations resembling
scales<a name="FNanchor_2020_2020" id="FNanchor_2020_2020"></a><a href="#Footnote_2020_2020" class="fnanchor">[2020]</a>.</p>

<p>I shall next say a few words upon the <i>spines</i> and other
<i>processes</i> which arm the thigh. Those moveable ones of
<i>Mantis</i> which help to form a fearful instrument of destruction,
have just been mentioned, and similar ones, but
less conspicuous, arm the intermediate thighs of <i>Sicus flavipes</i>:
other appendages of this kind are for a less destructive
purpose&mdash;to keep the tibia when folded in its
place. This seems to be the use of the serratures and
spine that arm the thigh of <i>Bruchus Bactris</i>, or the
Hymenopterous genera <i>Leucospis</i>, <i>Chalcis</i>, &amp;c.; in <i>Onitis
Aygulus</i> a short filiform horn arms the humerus, and a
longer crooked one that of many species of <i>Scaurus</i><a name="FNanchor_2021_2021" id="FNanchor_2021_2021"></a><a href="#Footnote_2021_2021" class="fnanchor">[2021]</a>. In
many <i>Stenocori</i> the thighs terminate in two spines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>
in <i>Gonyleptes</i> K. the posterior ones are armed internally
with very strong ones; with which, as the legs converge
at their knee<a name="FNanchor_2022_2022" id="FNanchor_2022_2022"></a><a href="#Footnote_2022_2022" class="fnanchor">[2022]</a>, they may probably detain their prey. The
knee-pan (<i>Gonytheca</i>) of the thigh, or the cavity at its
end, which receives the head of the <i>tibia</i>, is very conspicuous
in the weevils; but in no insects more than in
<i>Locusta</i><a name="FNanchor_2023_2023" id="FNanchor_2023_2023"></a><a href="#Footnote_2023_2023" class="fnanchor">[2023]</a>, in which tribe it deserves your particular attention.</p>

<p>d. <i>Tibia</i> or <i>Cubitus</i><a name="FNanchor_2024_2024" id="FNanchor_2024_2024"></a><a href="#Footnote_2024_2024" class="fnanchor">[2024]</a>. The <i>tibia</i> or shank is the <i>fourth</i>
joint of the leg, which according to the hypothesis lately
alluded to is the analogue, in the <i>anterior</i> leg of the <i>carpus</i>
or carpal bones, and in the <i>four posterior</i> ones of the
<i>tarsus</i> or tarsal bones of vertebrate animals. This may
be called the most conspicuous of the articulations of the
leg; for though it is generally more slender and often
shorter than the thigh, it falls more under the eye of the
observer, that joint being more or less concealed by the
body: it consists in general of a single joint; but in
the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i> and <i>PhalangidÃ¦</i> it has an accessory one,
often incrassated at its base, which I have named the
<i>Epicnemis</i><a name="FNanchor_2025_2025" id="FNanchor_2025_2025"></a><a href="#Footnote_2025_2025" class="fnanchor">[2025]</a>.</p>

<p>With respect to the <i>articulation</i> of the <i>tibia</i> with the
thigh&mdash;we may observe that in general it is by means of
<i>three</i> processes or condyles, two lateral and one intermediate,
of the head of the former joint<a name="FNanchor_2026_2026" id="FNanchor_2026_2026"></a><a href="#Footnote_2026_2026" class="fnanchor">[2026]</a>: the lateral ones
are usually received by a cavity or sinus of the <i>gonytheca</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[Pg 671]</a></span>
of the thigh<a name="FNanchor_2027_2027" id="FNanchor_2027_2027"></a><a href="#Footnote_2027_2027" class="fnanchor">[2027]</a>; and upon these the <i>tibia</i> turns, with a
semirotatory motion up and down as upon a pair of pivots:
at the same time the <i>mola</i> or head of the latter joint,
which has often a flexure so as to form an elbow with the
rest of it, inosculates in the <i>gonytheca</i>, and is also suspended
by ligament to the orifice through which the
muscles, nerves, and bronchiÃ¦ are transmitted: so that
in fact the articulation, strictly speaking, belongs exclusively
to none of the kinds observable in vertebrate animals,
but partakes of several, and may properly be denominated
a <i>mixed</i> articulation,&mdash;a term applicable in numerous
instances also to the other articulations of the legs
of insects. In the different Orders some variations in this
respect take place,&mdash;I will notice some of the most remarkable.
In no Coleopterous insects is the structure
more distinctly visible than in the larger Lamellicorns.
In <i>Copris bucephalus</i>, for instance, if you divide the thigh
longitudinally, you will find on each side, at the head,
that it is furnished with a nearly hemispherical protuberance,
perforated in the centre for the transmission of
muscles, and surrounded externally by a ridge, leaving a
semicircular cavity between them<a name="FNanchor_2028_2028" id="FNanchor_2028_2028"></a><a href="#Footnote_2028_2028" class="fnanchor">[2028]</a>: if you next examine
the <i>tibia</i>, after having extracted it, you will find on each
side, at the base, a cavity corresponding with the protuberance
of the thigh which it receives, having likewise a
central orifice, and surrounded by a semicircular ridge
corresponding with the cavity in the thigh in which it
acts: below this ridge another cavity, forming a small
segment of a circle, receives the ridge of the thigh<a name="FNanchor_2029_2029" id="FNanchor_2029_2029"></a><a href="#Footnote_2029_2029" class="fnanchor">[2029]</a>. You
will observe that the ridge of the <i>tibia</i> represents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
lateral condyle lately noticed: in the <i>DynastidÃ¦</i> this is
more prominent, and often forms a smaller segment of a
circle. In these also the protuberance of the thigh is
more minute, and its ridge is received by a cavity of the
<i>tibia</i> nearly semicircular<a name="FNanchor_2030_2030" id="FNanchor_2030_2030"></a><a href="#Footnote_2030_2030" class="fnanchor">[2030]</a>; in <i>Geotrupes</i> Latr. the articulation
is not very different, though on a reduced scale; in
<i>Calandra Palmarum</i> the lateral condyles of the <i>tibiÃ¦</i> are
flatter and broader<a name="FNanchor_2031_2031" id="FNanchor_2031_2031"></a><a href="#Footnote_2031_2031" class="fnanchor">[2031]</a>; and the articulation not being quite
so complex, this joint is kept steady by an intermediate
process observable in the <i>gonytheca</i><a name="FNanchor_2032_2032" id="FNanchor_2032_2032"></a><a href="#Footnote_2032_2032" class="fnanchor">[2032]</a>. From the above
description it appears that the dislocation of the <i>tibia</i> is
effectually prevented in the Lamellicorns by the protuberance
and ridge of the thigh working in their corresponding
cavities, while the condyle of that part turns with a
rotatory motion in the cavity of the thigh. In the <i>Orthoptera</i>
Order the <i>tibia</i> is suspended by a ligament, in
the <i>gonytheca</i> the lateral condyles, which are very prominent,
working in a sinus of that part<a name="FNanchor_2033_2033" id="FNanchor_2033_2033"></a><a href="#Footnote_2033_2033" class="fnanchor">[2033]</a>. The subsequent
Orders exhibit no very striking variations from
these types of articulation, I shall therefore not detain
you longer upon this head.</p>

<p>With regard to the <i>proportions</i> and <i>magnitude</i> of the
joint we are considering,&mdash;the most general law is, that
the <i>anterior</i> pair should be shorter and more slender than
the <i>intermediate</i>; and the <i>intermediate</i> than the <i>posterior</i>;
and that all the <i>tibiÃ¦</i> should be shorter and more slender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span>
than the <i>thighs</i>, and longer and thicker than the <i>tarsi</i>.
Various exceptions, however, to this rule in all these cases
might be produced; but I shall only observe that in all
those insects in which the fore-legs are calculated for digging
or seizing their prey, as in the <i>Petalocerous</i> beetles,
the <i>Gryllotalpa</i>, <i>Mantis</i>, &amp;c., this joint of the leg is
usually much enlarged and more conspicuous than the
others.</p>

<p>As to its <i>figure</i> and <i>shape</i>&mdash;most commonly the <i>tibia</i>
grows thicker from the base to the apex, as in the majority
of <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, &amp;c.; in the <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>,
&amp;c., it is generally equally thick every where.
Another peculiarity relating to this head observable in
it, is its tendency to a trigonal figure: this, however,
though very general, is not universal;&mdash;thus, in some
<i>Orthoptera</i>, as <i>Pterophylla</i> K., its horizontal section is
quadrangular; in others, as <i>Locusta</i> Leach and many
other insects, it is nearly a circle; in some scorpions it
is almost a hexagon. The superficial shape also of this
joint in numerous instances is more or less triangular,
but it sometimes recedes from this form:&mdash;thus, in
<i>Callichroma latipes</i> it is a segment of a circle; in some
<i>Empides</i> it is clavate; in <i>Onitis Sphinx</i>, dolabriform; in
the <i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>, &amp;c., it is usually linear; in
some <i>LygÃ¦i</i> it is angular<a name="FNanchor_2034_2034" id="FNanchor_2034_2034"></a><a href="#Footnote_2034_2034" class="fnanchor">[2034]</a>: but the most remarkable
<i>tibiÃ¦</i> in this respect are those of such species of this last
genus as have the posterior ones winged or foliaceous,
so that they resemble the leaf of some plant&mdash;the <i>tibia</i>
being the <i>rachis</i>, and the <i>wing</i> (which in some species
is veined) representing the <i>leaf</i> itself. This structure is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>
exemplified in <i>LygÃ¦us compressipes</i>, <i>phyllopus</i>, <i>foliaceus</i>,
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_2035_2035" id="FNanchor_2035_2035"></a><a href="#Footnote_2035_2035" class="fnanchor">[2035]</a> Under this head I must say a few words upon
the <i>flexure</i> of this joint, which in some cases merits notice.
I have before mentioned its bend at the knee<a name="FNanchor_2036_2036" id="FNanchor_2036_2036"></a><a href="#Footnote_2036_2036" class="fnanchor">[2036]</a> or
base: the apex also is sometimes incurved&mdash;in the anterior
one of the male of <i>Macropus longimanus</i> so as almost
to form a hook<a name="FNanchor_2037_2037" id="FNanchor_2037_2037"></a><a href="#Footnote_2037_2037" class="fnanchor">[2037]</a>: in <i>LygÃ¦us Pharaonis</i> the posterior pair
are flexuose<a name="FNanchor_2038_2038" id="FNanchor_2038_2038"></a><a href="#Footnote_2038_2038" class="fnanchor">[2038]</a>; in <i>Bruchus Bactris</i>, <i>Leucospis</i>, and several
species of <i>Chalcis</i>, these <i>tibiÃ¦</i> curve so as to adapt themselves
to the bend of the thigh when folded. The notch
on the inside of the anterior pair, in a large majority of
<i>Carabus</i> L., armed above by a spur<a name="FNanchor_2039_2039" id="FNanchor_2039_2039"></a><a href="#Footnote_2039_2039" class="fnanchor">[2039]</a>, a structure which
probably assists them in seizing and detaining their prey,
may also here be introduced: in the generality it is a little
removed from the apex of the joint in question; but
in <i>Pamborus</i> it is very near to it, and in <i>Cychrus</i>, <i>Carabus</i>,
&amp;c., it becomes obsolete. I may mention here also
a singular character which distinguishes the cubit of both
sexes of <i>Gryllus campestris</i>, <i>domesticus</i>, &amp;c. At the base
there is an aperture which passes through the joint&mdash;anteriorly
it is oval, and posteriorly elliptical and much
larger, and on both sides is closed by a tense membrane.</p>

<p>The most striking peculiarities as to the <i>clothing</i> of
his joint have been chiefly noticed under the sexual characters
of insects<a name="FNanchor_2040_2040" id="FNanchor_2040_2040"></a><a href="#Footnote_2040_2040" class="fnanchor">[2040]</a>, but some appear not to be of that description.
In <i>SphÃ¦ridium</i> Leach, while the thighs and
<i>tarsi</i> are naked, the posterior <i>tibiÃ¦</i> are remarkably beset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span>
with stiff bristles; in <i>Empis pennipes</i> they are thickly
fringed on both sides; in <i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> M<sup>c</sup>L. only externally,
and in <i>Dytiscus serricornis</i> internally; in <i>Necydalis
barpipes</i> K. this fringe is longer at the apex; and in <i>Saperda
hirtipes</i> Ol. the same <i>tibiÃ¦</i> at that part are adorned
with a large brush, like that observable in the antennÃ¦
of some <i>LamiÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_2041_2041" id="FNanchor_2041_2041"></a><a href="#Footnote_2041_2041" class="fnanchor">[2041]</a>.</p>

<p>I must next call your attention to the <i>teeth</i>, <i>spines</i>, and
<i>spurs</i> with which the <i>tibiÃ¦</i> of insects are sometimes armed.
With regard to <i>teeth</i>, you have doubtless often observed
those that distinguish the <i>cubitus</i> of the arm of most Lamellicorn
beetles: these vary in number from <i>one</i>, as in
<i>Trox suberosus</i>, to <i>seven</i>, as in <i>Geotrupes autumnalis</i>; but
the most universal number is <i>three</i>: in some species of
<i>Geotrupes</i>, as <i>G. stercorarius</i>, &amp;c., the <i>third</i> tooth from
the apex, and those that follow it, may be called <i>double</i>.
These teeth, in their cubit or anterior shank, doubtless
assist these insects in burrowing. The four posterior
<i>tibiÃ¦</i> in this tribe are also distinguished by a kind of teeth
which occupy their whole diameter, and resemble so
many steps. I have before noticed the remarkable cubit
of the <i>Gryllotalpa</i>, and likewise that of <i>Scarites</i>, <i>Pasimachus</i>,
&amp;c., in which some of the teeth are prolonged
into <i>spines</i><a name="FNanchor_2042_2042" id="FNanchor_2042_2042"></a><a href="#Footnote_2042_2042" class="fnanchor">[2042]</a>, which are the next description of tibial arms
that I mentioned. Spines are of <i>two</i> kinds&mdash;those which
are merely <i>processes</i> of the crust of the <i>tibia</i>, and those that
are <i>implanted</i> in it, and seem to have a <i>gomphosis</i> or perhaps
an <i>amphiarthrosis</i> articulation<a name="FNanchor_2043_2043" id="FNanchor_2043_2043"></a><a href="#Footnote_2043_2043" class="fnanchor">[2043]</a>. An instance of the
<i>first</i> kind may be seen in the hind-legs of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span>
grasshoppers<a name="FNanchor_2044_2044" id="FNanchor_2044_2044"></a><a href="#Footnote_2044_2044" class="fnanchor">[2044]</a> (<i>Locusta</i> Leach), the <i>RutelidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c. though in others
they are implanted:&mdash;of the <i>second</i>, in the <i>cubitus</i> of the
<i>MantidÃ¦</i>, and of <i>all</i> the <i>tibiÃ¦</i> of the dragon-flies (<i>Libellulina</i>
M<sup>c</sup>L.)<a name="FNanchor_2045_2045" id="FNanchor_2045_2045"></a><a href="#Footnote_2045_2045" class="fnanchor">[2045]</a>;&mdash;and of <i>both</i> kinds in the hind-legs of <i>Acrida</i> K.,
those which arm the upper angles of the tibiÃ¦ being <i>processes</i>,
and those of the lower being <i>implanted</i>. The term
<i>spine</i> I think ought to be restricted to the first kind; the
<i>second</i> ought rather to be denominated <i>spurs</i> (<i>calcaria</i>),
and may perhaps be regarded as in some degree synonymous
with those most important appendages of the joint
in question, that are implanted in or near their apex,
which have been hitherto distinguished by this last denomination,
and which I am next to consider. But though
I have not altered a term generally adopted, I must here
express my opinion that they ought rather to be considered
as minute <i>toes</i> or <i>fingers</i>, and that the denomination best
agreeing with their functions, as accessories to the main
toe, would be <i>digituli</i>: this is proved particularly by a
character peculiar to those of many species of the genus
<i>Cimbex</i> amongst the saw-flies, in which these organs are
furnished with a <i>sucker</i> or <i>pulvillus</i> (as they are also in
<i>&#338;nas</i> a kind of blister beetle), as well as the joints of the
tarsi<a name="FNanchor_2046_2046" id="FNanchor_2046_2046"></a><a href="#Footnote_2046_2046" class="fnanchor">[2046]</a>; which makes it evident that they are applied by
the animal to surfaces, and assist it in walking or climbing;
and in general it may be observed that in most insects
their principal use is connected with these motions,
and with burrowing. This circumstance tends to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span>
that the generality of insects (for all have not these
organs) have really a didactyle or tridactyle hand or
foot; and the hypothesis so often alluded to&mdash;that the
<i>cubitus</i> or <i>tibia</i>, &amp;c., is really analogous to the <i>carpus</i> or
<i>tarsus</i> in vertebrate animals<a name="FNanchor_2047_2047" id="FNanchor_2047_2047"></a><a href="#Footnote_2047_2047" class="fnanchor">[2047]</a>&mdash;seems to receive no small
confirmation from it; since, if the <i>spurs</i> be really analogous
to <i>fingers</i> or <i>toes</i>, the part they articulate with
cannot be the <i>tibia</i>, &amp;c. Though the parts in question
did not escape the notice of Reaumur, LinnÃ©, De
Geer, Latreille, &amp;c., yet they have not been employed
in the determination of tribes, genera, &amp;c., except by the
author last named, but perhaps adopted from Bonelli<a name="FNanchor_2048_2048" id="FNanchor_2048_2048"></a><a href="#Footnote_2048_2048" class="fnanchor">[2048]</a>,
in the subgenera <i>Zabrus</i> and <i>Pelorus</i>: in many instances,
however, they afford excellent subsidiary characters,
sometimes common to a whole Order, and at others distinguishing
its various subdivisions. With regard to
their <i>number</i>&mdash;I have noticed many variations which I will
now state to you, first observing that I shall express them
by <i>three</i> figures, the <i>first</i> representing the number of spurs
on the <i>anterior</i> leg, the <i>second</i> that of those on the <i>intermediate</i>,
and the <i>third</i> on the <i>posterior</i>; and where there
are spurs, as in the <i>Trichoptera</i> and <i>Lepidoptera</i>, on the
<i>middle</i> as well as at the <i>end</i> of the <i>tibia</i>, I shall express it
by one figure <i>over</i> another, the upper one representing the
number of the <i>middle</i> spurs. If you make an examination
yourself, it will be proper to remind you that these
little organs are extremely liable to be broken off, but the
socket in which they were planted is usually very visible.
The most <i>natural</i> number is represented by 2:2:2; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>
you will find very prevalent in the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order,
as in the Predaceous and numerous other beetles: in
the <i>Orthoptera</i> and <i>Hemiptera</i> Orders, however, I have
not discovered an instance of it; but in all the rest it
more or less occurs: next to this number&mdash;<i>tibiÃ¦</i> with
obsolete or no spurs seem most prevalent, particularly in
the <i>Hemiptera</i>; not a single instance of an insect furnished
with them occurring to me in the <i>Heteropterous</i>
section; and it is doubtful whether there are any in the
<i>Homopterous</i>.&mdash;Having stated the most universal structure
in this respect, I will next consider the Orders seriatim.
Amongst the <i>Coleoptera</i> though the numbers
2:2:2 are most frequent in occurrence, yet there are
numerous exceptions. Thus, in the Lamellicorns, 1:1:1
represents the <i>calcaria</i> of one tribe of the <i>ScarabÃ¦idÃ¦</i> M<sup>c</sup>L.
formed of the genus <i>ScarabÃ¦us</i> M<sup>c</sup>L.; 1:2:1 represents
those of another tribe of that family, including the subgenera
<i>Ateuchus</i>, <i>Copris</i>, <i>PhanÃ¦us</i>, &amp;c.; 1:2:2 again
forms the character in this respect of <i>Aphodius</i> and the
great majority of the Lamellicorns; while 2:2:2 is confined
in this section to <i>Ãsalus</i> F. and <i>Melolontha chrysomeloides</i>
Schranck (<i>Psephus</i> M<sup>c</sup>L. MS.). In the other
tribes of <i>Coleoptera</i> other numbers occur. Thus, 0:1:1
characterizes <i>Hyl&#339;cetus</i>; 0:1:2 <i>Mordella</i>; 0:2:2 <i>Macropus</i>;
<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>1</sub></small>:2:2 <i>Harpalus</i>, and all those <i>Carabi</i> L., except
<i>Zabrus</i>, that have a <i>notch</i> in their anterior <i>tibiÃ¦</i>;
&frac12;:2:2 <i>Zabrus</i>. In the <i>Orthoptera</i> Order it is not easy
to distinguish the real <i>spurs</i> from the implanted <i>spines</i>
that frequently arm the legs: these in <i>Blatta</i> are extremely
numerous, even at the apex of the <i>tibiÃ¦</i>; but I
cannot distinguish any that can be regarded as true analogues
of the former: the most natural number of spurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span>
in this Order is represented by 0:0:4; this you will see
in all the Locusts; in <i>Acrida</i>, <i>Conocephala</i>, <i>Pterophylla</i>;
and in <i>Truxalis</i>, <i>Pneumora</i>, &amp;c.; in <i>Phasma</i> there are
none. In <i>Mantis</i>, if the terminal process of the <i>cubitus</i>
is excluded, it will be 0:2:2; in <i>Gryllotalpa</i>, admitting
the terminal teeth of that part<a name="FNanchor_2049_2049" id="FNanchor_2049_2049"></a><a href="#Footnote_2049_2049" class="fnanchor">[2049]</a> as analogues of spurs,
the number is 4:4:4; in <i>Tridactylus</i> Latr. 0:0:5<a name="FNanchor_2050_2050" id="FNanchor_2050_2050"></a><a href="#Footnote_2050_2050" class="fnanchor">[2050]</a>; in
<i>Gryllus</i> Latr. 3:3:5; in <i>Gryllus monstrosus</i>, 4:4:6. In
the whole <i>Hemiptera</i> Order I have discovered no instance
of an insect furnished with the real spurs: for though in
<i>Tettigonia</i> F., <i>Cercopis</i>, &amp;c., there are implanted spines in
the posterior <i>tibia</i>, and several at the apex, there are none
of them clearly analogous to real spurs. In the <i>Lepidoptera</i>
the most general arrangement appears to be <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub></small>:2:2/2;
and next to this, <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub></small>:2:2. In this Order most commonly
there is no spur at the end of the cubit, but one resembling
a thumb<a name="FNanchor_2051_2051" id="FNanchor_2051_2051"></a><a href="#Footnote_2051_2051" class="fnanchor">[2051]</a> arms its middle; in <i>Pieris</i>, &amp;c., this
thumb is not present, so that the number is 0:2:2; in
<i>Agarista</i> Leach, <i>Erebus</i>, &amp;c., you will find <small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>0</sub></small>:2:4, the
posterior <i>calcaria</i> being all terminal; and in <i>Attacus
Atlas</i>, all these organs are obsolete except the thumb.
In the <i>Neuroptera</i> the most general arrangement is
2:2:2; but in the <i>Libellulina</i>, although the legs are very
spinose, there are no spurs. In the <i>Trichoptera</i> K., in
<i>Phryganea rhombica</i> and affinities, the number of them
is expressed by &frac12;:&frac12;:&frac12;; and in those with long antennÃ¦,
<i>P. atra</i>, &amp;c., by <small><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></small>:<small><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></small>:<small><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></small>. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> the number
1:2:2 is most prevalent; and next to this, as in <i>Apis</i> L.,
1:1:2. In the <i>Ichneumones minuti</i> L. the spurs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[Pg 680]</a></span>
1:1:1; in <i>Atta</i> Latreille, a kind of ant<a name="FNanchor_2052_2052" id="FNanchor_2052_2052"></a><a href="#Footnote_2052_2052" class="fnanchor">[2052]</a>, 1:0:0. In the
<i>Diptera</i> it is often difficult to distinguish the spurs from
the spines; but the number most universal is, I think,
2:2:2; in <i>Tipula</i> it is 1:2:2; in the <i>TabanidÃ¦</i> 0:2:0;
and in <i>Culex</i>, <i>Limonia</i>, &amp;c., there are none. Amongst
the insects with more than six legs, most commonly the
tibiÃ¦ have no spurs; but in the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i> each is armed
with <i>two</i>, a circumstance which also distinguishes the
corresponding joint of the <i>pedipalpi</i>.</p>

<p>These little organs inosculate each in an appropriate
socket of the end, or in many cases of the middle of the
<i>tibia</i>; and that part of their head or base that is received
by it, is often constricted for the purpose: from hence
it follows that they are capable of some degree of motion,
but in some insects, as those on the four posterior legs of
<i>ScarabÃ¦us sacer</i> and its more immediate affinities, and
those at the end of the cubit of <i>Gryllotalpa</i>, they are immoveable,
and appear almost processes of the joint to
which they belong. They are commonly sharp, of a
subtriquetrous figure, with the lower side flat: where
there are two, the outer one is usually the longest; and
in general the spurs on the hind legs are longer than
those on the four anterior: but there are exceptions&mdash;thus,
in <i>Acanthopus</i> Latr. the <i>intermediate</i> spurs are the
longest; and in <i>Cicindela</i> the <i>anterior</i> are longer than
the former; in <i>Blaps mortisaga</i> those on all the legs are
nearly equal in length. They vary sometimes in <i>shape</i>&mdash;those
on the middle of the cubit of many <i>Lepidoptera</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
which may be regarded as a kind of thumb<a name="FNanchor_2053_2053" id="FNanchor_2053_2053"></a><a href="#Footnote_2053_2053" class="fnanchor">[2053]</a>, are of a
lanceolate shape; in <i>Meloe</i> the external posterior one is
flat and obtuse; in <i>&#338;nas</i> Latr. it is obconical, concave
at the extremity, and apparently furnished with a sucker;
in <i>Ateuchus smaragdulus</i> the <i>anterior</i>, and in <i>Copris Carolina</i>
the <i>posterior</i> is forked and emarginate; in <i>Sirex</i> the
former is hooked and winged; in <i>Lamprima</i> it is triangular
and dilated; in <i>Aphodius analis</i> it is dolabriform;
in <i>Dynastes retusus</i> and <i>Juvencus</i> the spurs are bent like
a bow. In many <i>Hymenoptera</i>, as the <i>SphecidÃ¦</i>, they are
pectinated<a name="FNanchor_2054_2054" id="FNanchor_2054_2054"></a><a href="#Footnote_2054_2054" class="fnanchor">[2054]</a>, with a series of minute parallel spines&mdash;a
structure which assists the animal in burrowing<a name="FNanchor_2055_2055" id="FNanchor_2055_2055"></a><a href="#Footnote_2055_2055" class="fnanchor">[2055]</a>; in
<i>Acanthopus</i> Latr. they are armed with little teeth or
spines<a name="FNanchor_2056_2056" id="FNanchor_2056_2056"></a><a href="#Footnote_2056_2056" class="fnanchor">[2056]</a>; in the hive bee the spur of the cubit is furnished
with a membranous appendage which I have called the
velum<a name="FNanchor_2057_2057" id="FNanchor_2057_2057"></a><a href="#Footnote_2057_2057" class="fnanchor">[2057]</a>; and in a subgenus related to <i>Saropoda</i> Latr.
(<i>Ctenoplectra</i> K. MS.), the interior spur of the posterior
leg is crescent-shaped, fixed transversely, and fitted on
the inner side with a membrane, the edge of which is
finally pectinated.</p>

<p>e. <i>Tarsus</i> or <i>Manus</i><a name="FNanchor_2058_2058" id="FNanchor_2058_2058"></a><a href="#Footnote_2058_2058" class="fnanchor">[2058]</a>. This is the <i>last</i> portion of the
leg, usually supposed to be analogous to the hand or
foot of vertebrate animals; but, according to the hypothesis
so often alluded to, rather the representative of
their jointed finger or toe. In treating of this part I
shall consider its <i>articulation</i> with the <i>tibia</i>, and of its
joints <i>inter se</i>; the <i>number</i> of those joints; their <i>proportion</i>
and <i>shape</i>; their <i>parts</i> and <i>appendages</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span></p>

<p>I seem to have observed <i>three</i> kinds of tarsal <i>articulation</i>.
The <i>first</i> is a species of <i>enarthrosis</i> or ball and socket,
the joints terminating in a globular head, perforated indeed
for the transmission of muscles, &amp;c., and which is
received by a corresponding cavity of the <i>tibia</i> or preceding
joint, as may be seen in many weevils (<i>Curculio</i>
L.<a name="FNanchor_2059_2059" id="FNanchor_2059_2059"></a><a href="#Footnote_2059_2059" class="fnanchor">[2059]</a>). This admits of some rotatory motion.&mdash;The <i>second</i>
is a <i>mixed</i> articulation between <i>enarthrosis</i> and <i>ginglymus</i>,
when at the base of the ball a deep transverse
channel receives a corresponding ridge of the <i>tibiÃ¦</i> or
preceding joint: this may be found in <i>Rutela</i> and probably
many other Lamellicorn beetles; and something
very similar in the Predaceous ones.&mdash;The <i>third</i> kind is
where there is little or no inosculation, and the joints are
scarcely more than <i>suspended</i>: this takes place in the
<i>Orthoptera</i>, <i>Neuroptera</i>, &amp;c.; but in <i>Blatta</i> and the hind
legs of <i>Mantis</i> there is some approach to the foregoing
kinds.</p>

<p>We are now to consider the <i>number</i> of joints of the
<i>tarsus</i>, which varies considerably in the different Orders,
and in one has been assumed as a clue for a subdivision
of it into sections<a name="FNanchor_2060_2060" id="FNanchor_2060_2060"></a><a href="#Footnote_2060_2060" class="fnanchor">[2060]</a>, which, though not perfectly natural,
is very convenient, and has been adopted by most modern
Entomologists. In treating of this head, I shall use
those denominations that have been employed by M. Latreille
and others to express the variations of the number
of the tarsal joints in the <i>Coleoptera</i>, but shall apply
them to insects in general. Insects in this view, therefore,
may be called <i>pentamerous</i>; <i>heteromerous</i>; <i>tetramerous</i>;
<i>trimerous</i>; <i>dimerous</i>; or <i>monomerous</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pentamerous</i> insects are those which have <i>five</i> joints in
<i>all</i> their <i>tarsi</i>. This is the most universal, and may be
called the <i>natural</i> number of these joints. More than half
the <i>Coleoptera</i> belong to this section; in the <i>Orthoptera</i>&mdash;the
<i>BlattidÃ¦</i>, <i>MantidÃ¦</i>, and <i>PhasmidÃ¦</i>; all the <i>Lepidoptera</i>
except those butterflies called <i>tetrapi</i> (<i>Vanessa</i>,
&amp;c.); all the <i>Trichoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, and <i>Diptera</i>;
in the <i>Neuroptera</i>&mdash;<i>Ascalaphus</i>, <i>Myrmeleon</i>, <i>Hemerobius</i>,
<i>Corydalis</i>, &amp;c.; and in the <i>Aptera</i>&mdash;<i>Pulex</i><a name="FNanchor_2061_2061" id="FNanchor_2061_2061"></a><a href="#Footnote_2061_2061" class="fnanchor">[2061]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Heteromerous</i> insects are those in which the number
of these joints varies in the different pairs of legs<a name="FNanchor_2062_2062" id="FNanchor_2062_2062"></a><a href="#Footnote_2062_2062" class="fnanchor">[2062]</a>. These
variations, like the spurs, may be expressed by three
figures, the first representing the <i>anterior tarsus</i>, the
second the <i>intermediate</i>, and the third the <i>posterior</i>. I
begin with 5:5:4. This number represents those beetles
that have been <i>exclusively</i> regarded as <i>heteromerous</i> by
modern Entomologists&mdash;of this description is the Linnean
<i>Tenebrio</i>, <i>Meloe</i>, &amp;c., now subdivided into numerous
genera; they have <i>five</i> joints in the two anterior
pair, and <i>four</i> in the posterior. The tarsal joints of the
aquatic genus <i>Hydroporus</i> (a singular anomaly in the
Order to which they belong) are expressed by 4:4:5,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span>
thus reversing the number in the preceding tribe: other
Heteromerous genera are to be found amongst the <i>Hemiptera</i>.
Thus, in <i>Ranatra</i> the numbers are 2:1:1; in
<i>Sigara</i> and <i>Nauceris</i> 1:2:2; in a new subgenus between
<i>Belostoma</i> and <i>Naucoris</i> (<i>Xiphostoma</i> K. MS.), brought
by Dr. Bigsby from Canada, 3:2:2; in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>
the butterflies called <i>tetrapi</i> (<i>Vanessa</i>, &amp;c.) may be expressed
by 1:5:5. Amongst the <i>Aptera</i> and <i>Arachnida</i>
there are three remarkable genera, which if their pedipalps
are included may be deemed Heteromerous. I
mean <i>Phrynus</i>, <i>Thelyphena</i>, and <i>Galeodes</i>;&mdash;in the former
the numbers will be *:4:4:4, the asterisk denoting
more than ten; in the second, 8:4:4:4.; and in <i>Galeodes</i> (in which the first pair of pedipalps are not chelate,
the mandibles performing their office) the numbers are
1:1:3:3:3.<a name="FNanchor_2063_2063" id="FNanchor_2063_2063"></a><a href="#Footnote_2063_2063" class="fnanchor">[2063]</a></p>

<p><i>Tetramerous</i> insects are those in which all the <i>tarsi</i>
consist of <i>four</i> joints; these in the <i>Coleoptera</i> are next in
number to the <i>pentamerous</i>&mdash;indeed a very large proportion
of them strictly speaking are really of the latter
description, since in LinnÃ©'s four great genera, <i>Curculio</i>,
<i>Cerambyx</i>, <i>Chrysomela</i>, and <i>Cassida</i> and some others,
the <i>claw-joint</i> (<i>ungula</i>) consists of <i>two</i> articulations, one
very short, forming merely the ball at its base<a name="FNanchor_2064_2064" id="FNanchor_2064_2064"></a><a href="#Footnote_2064_2064" class="fnanchor">[2064]</a>, which
inosculates in the socket of the preceding joint, and the
other constituting the remainder: if you carefully separate
these two pieces, you will find that the last inosculates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
in the summit of the ball, and is moved by appropriate
muscles<a name="FNanchor_2065_2065" id="FNanchor_2065_2065"></a><a href="#Footnote_2065_2065" class="fnanchor">[2065]</a>. This structure probably permits the
readier elevation and depression of this joint. In the
<i>Orthoptera</i> the tetramerous genera are those which
LinnÃ© called <i>Tettigonia</i> amongst his <i>Grylli</i> (<i>Locusta</i> F.);
<i>Acheta monstrosa</i> also, and in the <i>Neuroptera</i>, <i>Raphidia</i>
belong to this section.</p>

<p><i>Trimerous</i> insects are those whose <i>tarsi</i> consist of only
<i>three</i> joints. Amongst beetles the Lady-birds (<i>Coccinella</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">L.) are remarkable for this structure, but in them</span><br />
the claw-joint is also <i>biarticulate</i>, so that strictly speaking
they are <i>tetramerous</i>; in the <i>Orthopterous</i> Order the
migratory locusts (<i>Locusta</i> Leach) belong to this section,
as likewise <i>Gryllus</i> Latr. and <i>Gryllotalpa</i> Latr.:
in the first of these genera is an appearance of there being
more joints in the <i>tarsus</i>, because there is more than
one cushion below the first<a name="FNanchor_2066_2066" id="FNanchor_2066_2066"></a><a href="#Footnote_2066_2066" class="fnanchor">[2066]</a>. To this section also belong
the great majority of the <i>Hemiptera</i>, excluding only those
tribes that connect the two sections of the Order constituting
the two Linnean genera <i>Nepa</i> and <i>Notonecta</i>; the
<i>Libellulina</i> likewise belong here, as do also the <i>ScorpionidÃ¦</i>
and <i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dimerous</i> insects are those that have <i>two</i> joints in
all their <i>tarsi</i>. Such are the <i>PselaphidÃ¦</i> in the Coleoptera
Order<a name="FNanchor_2067_2067" id="FNanchor_2067_2067"></a><a href="#Footnote_2067_2067" class="fnanchor">[2067]</a>; in the <i>Hemiptera</i>&mdash;<i>Belostoma</i> and <i>Notonecta</i>;
in the hexapod <i>Aptera</i>&mdash;<i>Pediculus</i>; in the octopod&mdash;the
<i>Acari</i> of LinnÃ©; in the myriapod&mdash;<i>Iulus</i>; and
in the <i>Arachnida</i>&mdash;the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Monomerous</i> insects are those which have only a single
tarsal joint. Only one Coleopterous and also one Hemipterous
genus is so distinguished: the first is <i>Dermestes
Armadillus</i> De Geer<a name="FNanchor_2068_2068" id="FNanchor_2068_2068"></a><a href="#Footnote_2068_2068" class="fnanchor">[2068]</a>, and the second the common
water-scorpion, <i>Nepa</i> Latr. Among the <i>Aptera</i> we
find <i>Nirmus</i>, <i>Podura</i>, <i>Sminthurus</i>, &amp;c., that belong to this
section.</p>

<p>To the above sections another may be added for those
insects whose <i>tarsi</i> have more than <i>five</i> joints, which may
be denominated <i>Polymerous</i>. Here belong the genera
<i>Gonyleptes</i> K., <i>Phalangium</i> and <i>Scutigera</i> Latr. In the
first the number of joints varies from <i>six</i> to <i>eleven</i>, and
in the two last they far exceed that number, amounting
in some species of <i>Phalangium</i> to more than <i>fifty</i>, and
becoming convolute like the antennÃ¦ of Ichneumons<a name="FNanchor_2069_2069" id="FNanchor_2069_2069"></a><a href="#Footnote_2069_2069" class="fnanchor">[2069]</a>.</p>

<p>I am next to notice the <i>proportions</i> and <i>shape</i> of the
<i>tarsus</i> and its joints. The most general law is, that it
shall be shorter and more slender than the <i>tibia</i>; but it
admits of several exceptions&mdash;thus, in <i>Megasoma</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_2070_2070" id="FNanchor_2070_2070"></a><a href="#Footnote_2070_2070" class="fnanchor">[2070]</a>, in
<i>all</i> the legs; in <i>Agrostiphila</i> M<sup>c</sup>L. MS.<a name="FNanchor_2071_2071" id="FNanchor_2071_2071"></a><a href="#Footnote_2071_2071" class="fnanchor">[2071]</a> in the <i>intermediate</i>,
and in <i>Amphicoma lineata</i> in the <i>posterior</i> pair
the <i>tarsi</i> are the longest; in <i>Trichius Delta</i> these last
are longer than the thigh and <i>tibia</i> together. In some
insects the <i>tarsi</i> are disproportionally short, as in <i>Cassida</i>,
the <i>PselaphidÃ¦</i>, <i>Locusta</i> Leach, &amp;c. Though generally
more slender than the <i>tibia</i>, in several instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[Pg 687]</a></span>
they are as thick or thicker, or more dilated, as in most
of the tetramerous beetles, which being climbers require
a dilated <i>tarsus</i>. Again, comparing the three pairs of
this joint with each other, the most general rule is, that
the <i>anterior</i> should be the <i>shortest</i>, and the <i>posterior</i> the
<i>longest</i>: but in some, as the Capricorn beetles, &amp;c., they
are nearly equal in length; in others, as <i>Lytta marginata</i>,
the <i>anterior</i> pair, and in <i>Rhipiphorus</i> the <i>intermediate</i>,
are the longest; in <i>Trichius Delta</i> these last are the
shortest. With respect to <i>thickness</i>, the anterior <i>tarsi</i>,
except in many males<a name="FNanchor_2072_2072" id="FNanchor_2072_2072"></a><a href="#Footnote_2072_2072" class="fnanchor">[2072]</a>, are not very strikingly different
from the rest.</p>

<p>With regard to the proportion of the joints of the
<i>tarsus</i> to each other,&mdash;according to the most general law,
the first is the longest, the last next in length, then the
second and third, and the fourth is the shortest. In <i>Gonyleptes</i>
K. and other <i>PhalangidÃ¦</i> the first is almost thrice
the length of all the rest taken together; but there are
numerous exceptions to the rule. In the female <i>Carabi</i>
the first joint is not longer than the last, and in the males
not so long; and in <i>Hydrophilus</i>, &amp;c., it is the shortest of
all. Again, the second joint is longer than the three following
ones in <i>Dasytes ater</i><a name="FNanchor_2073_2073" id="FNanchor_2073_2073"></a><a href="#Footnote_2073_2073" class="fnanchor">[2073]</a>; and than the last in <i>Cicindela
sylvatica</i>: the <i>third</i> joint is shorter than the fourth in <i>Lampyris
ignita</i>: it is longer than the first in <i>Donacia</i>, many
<i>MelolonthidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c. Once more, the <i>fourth</i> joint, usually
the shortest of all, is longer than the second and third
in <i>Anthia</i>, &amp;c. Lastly, the claw-joint, usually the second
in length, in the <i>Eproboscidea</i> Latr. (<i>Hippobosca</i> L.) is
very long and large, while the four first joints are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>
extremely short as to be scarcely distinguishable from
each other: it is the shortest of all in <i>Colymbetes</i>, &amp;c.;
it is of the length of the <i>third</i> in <i>Cicindela sylvatica</i>, of
the <i>fourth</i> in <i>C. sexguttata</i>. Though commonly the slenderest
joint of all, particularly so in <i>Raphidia</i>, in many
Heteromerous and Lamellicorn beetles it is the largest,
conspicuously so in <i>Mellinus tricinctus</i>. Sometimes, as
in <i>Buprestis chrysis</i>, &amp;c., all the tarsal joints are nearly
equal in length and thickness.</p>

<p>We are next to say something upon the <i>shape</i> of the
<i>tarsi</i> and their joints. In general we may first observe
that their upper surface is commonly more or less convex,
and the lower flat or concave: in insects that are
swift <i>runners</i>, as the terrestrial Predaceous beetles, they
are usually slender and filiform<a name="FNanchor_2074_2074" id="FNanchor_2074_2074"></a><a href="#Footnote_2074_2074" class="fnanchor">[2074]</a>; in those that swim, as
<i>Dytiscus</i>, the two posterior pair taper nearly to a point
from the base to the apex<a name="FNanchor_2075_2075" id="FNanchor_2075_2075"></a><a href="#Footnote_2075_2075" class="fnanchor">[2075]</a>; in some that climb, as <i>Buprestis</i>,
they are rather flat and linear; and in others (the
Weevils, <i>Curculio</i> L.) they grow gradually wider towards
the claw-joint<a name="FNanchor_2076_2076" id="FNanchor_2076_2076"></a><a href="#Footnote_2076_2076" class="fnanchor">[2076]</a>; sometimes, as in <i>Mordella</i> Latr., the four
anterior <i>tarsi</i> are of this shape, and the posterior pair
setaceous. In <i>Gyrinus</i> the four posterior are flat and
triangular; and in that extraordinary insect <i>Gryllus monstrosus</i>
the <i>tarsi</i> are foliaceous and lobed<a name="FNanchor_2077_2077" id="FNanchor_2077_2077"></a><a href="#Footnote_2077_2077" class="fnanchor">[2077]</a>. In many
males and some others the <i>anterior</i> pair or <i>hands</i> are of
a different shape from the two <i>posterior</i>: thus, in several
<i>Carabi</i> they are lanceolate; in <i>Staphylinus</i>, <i>Creophilus</i>,
&amp;c. in both sexes they are often nearly circular, like
those of male <i>Dytisci</i><a name="FNanchor_2078_2078" id="FNanchor_2078_2078"></a><a href="#Footnote_2078_2078" class="fnanchor">[2078]</a>. With regard to the <i>shape</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span>
individual joints it may be said in general that they are
rather triangular, with an anterior sinus for the reception
of the succeeding joint: the first joint usually departs most
from this form; in the bees it is commonly much larger
than the rest, especially in the last pair of legs, and nearly
forming a parallelogram<a name="FNanchor_2079_2079" id="FNanchor_2079_2079"></a><a href="#Footnote_2079_2079" class="fnanchor">[2079]</a>; in <i>Euglossa</i> it is trapezoidal; in
the majority nearly linear or filiform. With regard to
their <i>termination</i>&mdash;in <i>Brachycerus</i> and some ants (<i>Ponera</i>,
<i>Myrmica</i>, &amp;c., Latr.) the <i>three first</i> joints; in <i>Dascillus</i>,
<i>Lycus reticulatus</i> and affinities, the <i>third</i> and <i>fourth</i>; and
in the great majority of the Tetramerous insects the
<i>penultimate</i> joint is bilobed; although in most Predaceous
beetles this joint is entire or simply emarginate, yet in
<i>Colliuris</i> it terminates in a single oblique lobe; and in
<i>Lebia</i>, <i>Drypta</i>, &amp;c., it is nearly bipartite. I must now
advert to the <i>Ungula</i> or claw-joint: it is usually clavate
or thickest at the end and curved; but in the <i>AsilidÃ¦</i> it
is shaped like a vase or cup; in <i>PhanÃ¦us</i>, in the four
posterior <i>tarsi</i>, in which the claws are obsolete, it is
thickest at the base and sharpest at the extremity<a name="FNanchor_2080_2080" id="FNanchor_2080_2080"></a><a href="#Footnote_2080_2080" class="fnanchor">[2080]</a>; it
usually forms an angle with the rest of the <i>tarsus</i>, rising
upwards, which enables the insect to move more easily
without hindrance from the claws, and also more readily
to lay hold of any object it meets with; but in the Lamellicorn
beetles and many other insects it is in the same
line with it. As in the beetles last mentioned this joint
is often inserted in the extremity of the preceding one;
but in <i>&#338;demera</i> it articulates with the middle of its
upper surface; and in <i>Lycus</i> and a numerous host of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span>
<i>Tetramerous</i> beetles it springs from its base, just behind
where it diverges into two lobes.</p>

<p>I shall next call your attention to the different kinds
of <i>appendages</i> with which the <i>tarsi</i> are furnished. They
are seldom armed, like the <i>tibiÃ¦</i>, with teeth, or spines,
or horns; but something of the kind occasionally distinguishes
them. In <i>Phileurus</i>, <i>Oryctes</i>, and several other
<i>DynastidÃ¦</i>, the first joint is armed at the apex externally
with a considerable mucro; in the fore-leg of <i>Dasytes
ater</i> a similar process is prolonged into a crooked horn<a name="FNanchor_2081_2081" id="FNanchor_2081_2081"></a><a href="#Footnote_2081_2081" class="fnanchor">[2081]</a>.
But the most important appendages of the <i>tarsi</i> are the
<i>claws</i> which almost universally arm their extremity, and
which appear clearly analogous to those of <i>birds</i>, <i>quadrupeds</i>,
&amp;c., though probably differing as to their substance<a name="FNanchor_2082_2082" id="FNanchor_2082_2082"></a><a href="#Footnote_2082_2082" class="fnanchor">[2082]</a>.
Some few, however, are without them; this, as
I lately observed, is the case with <i>PhanÃ¦us</i> with respect
to the four <i>posterior</i> legs; the <i>anterior</i> ones of <i>Vanessa</i>
amongst the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and all those of <i>Stylops</i> and
many <i>Acari</i> L., are also without them: this is likewise
the case with the first pair of legs, or the second of the
pedipalps of <i>Galeodes</i>. In this genus these organs consist
of two joints<a name="FNanchor_2083_2083" id="FNanchor_2083_2083"></a><a href="#Footnote_2083_2083" class="fnanchor">[2083]</a>. With respect to <i>number</i> they vary
in different tribes, but not so much as the <i>calcaria</i>:
these variations may likewise be represented by three
numbers. The most natural is <i>two</i> in all the <i>tarsi</i>, exhibited
by the Predaceous beetles and the great majority;
2.2.1. are to be found in <i>Hoplia</i>, <i>Anisonyx</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_2084_2084" id="FNanchor_2084_2084"></a><a href="#Footnote_2084_2084" class="fnanchor">[2084]</a>;
1.2.2. in <i>Belostoma</i>; three in all the legs in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span>
<i>AraneidÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_2085_2085" id="FNanchor_2085_2085"></a><a href="#Footnote_2085_2085" class="fnanchor">[2085]</a>; in <i>Meloe</i><a name="FNanchor_2086_2086" id="FNanchor_2086_2086"></a><a href="#Footnote_2086_2086" class="fnanchor">[2086]</a>, <i>Elater</i>, &amp;c., each claw is double or
consisting of two, which makes <i>four</i> in each leg; and in
many <i>HippoboscidÃ¦</i> there are <i>six</i><a name="FNanchor_2087_2087" id="FNanchor_2087_2087"></a><a href="#Footnote_2087_2087" class="fnanchor">[2087]</a>; in <i>Nepa</i> and the
Myriapods there is only <i>one</i>. In most insects, perhaps,
the claws are simple or undivided<a name="FNanchor_2088_2088" id="FNanchor_2088_2088"></a><a href="#Footnote_2088_2088" class="fnanchor">[2088]</a>; but in <i>Galeruca</i>,
<i>Melolontha subspinosa</i><a name="FNanchor_2089_2089" id="FNanchor_2089_2089"></a><a href="#Footnote_2089_2089" class="fnanchor">[2089]</a>, &amp;c., they are bifid at the apex; as
is the exterior claw of the four posterior legs in <i>Chasmodia</i>
and <i>Macraspis</i><a name="FNanchor_2090_2090" id="FNanchor_2090_2090"></a><a href="#Footnote_2090_2090" class="fnanchor">[2090]</a> M<sup>c</sup>L., and of <i>all</i> in <i>Melolontha horticola</i>;
in <i>Serica brunnea</i> M<sup>c</sup>L. the claws are all cleft at
the extremity, but the internal tooth is broad, flat, and
obtuse<a name="FNanchor_2091_2091" id="FNanchor_2091_2091"></a><a href="#Footnote_2091_2091" class="fnanchor">[2091]</a>; in <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i> and <i>Pelidnota punctata</i>
M<sup>c</sup>L.<a name="FNanchor_2092_2092" id="FNanchor_2092_2092"></a><a href="#Footnote_2092_2092" class="fnanchor">[2092]</a>, the claws are armed with an internal tooth near
the base<a name="FNanchor_2093_2093" id="FNanchor_2093_2093"></a><a href="#Footnote_2093_2093" class="fnanchor">[2093]</a>. In the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i>, which have three claws, the
two external ones are furnished with several parallel
teeth, which the animal uses to keep separate the threads
of its web, and probably for other purposes<a name="FNanchor_2094_2094" id="FNanchor_2094_2094"></a><a href="#Footnote_2094_2094" class="fnanchor">[2094]</a>; and some
Predaceous beetles, as <i>Lebia</i> and <i>Cymindis</i>, have both
their claws similarly furnished<a name="FNanchor_2095_2095" id="FNanchor_2095_2095"></a><a href="#Footnote_2095_2095" class="fnanchor">[2095]</a>. These organs vary in
their relative <i>proportions</i>: thus, in <i>Anoplognathus</i> the
inner claw is much smaller than the other<a name="FNanchor_2096_2096" id="FNanchor_2096_2096"></a><a href="#Footnote_2096_2096" class="fnanchor">[2096]</a>; and in <i>Elater
sulcatus</i>, <i>fuscipes</i>, &amp;c., it is represented by a mere bristle;
in <i>Hoplia</i>, in the anterior <i>tarsus</i> it is not half the length
of the outer one<a name="FNanchor_2097_2097" id="FNanchor_2097_2097"></a><a href="#Footnote_2097_2097" class="fnanchor">[2097]</a>; in <i>Areoda</i> and <i>Pelidnota</i> M<sup>c</sup>L. this
last is the smallest. They vary also in length&mdash;in <i>RynchÃ¦nus</i>,
<i>Ascalaphus</i>, &amp;c., they are very short; in the Lamellicorns,
<i>Galeodes</i>, &amp;c., very long; and in <i>Myrmeleon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span>
longer than the claw-joint. With regard to their <i>curvature</i>
they generally form the segment of a circle; in many
<i>AsilidÃ¦</i> they are crooked like the claws of the eagle<a name="FNanchor_2098_2098" id="FNanchor_2098_2098"></a><a href="#Footnote_2098_2098" class="fnanchor">[2098]</a>,
and the posterior one of the <i>HopliÃ¦</i> is bent like a hook<a name="FNanchor_2099_2099" id="FNanchor_2099_2099"></a><a href="#Footnote_2099_2099" class="fnanchor">[2099]</a>;
they most commonly diverge from each other; but in
the <i>RutelidÃ¦</i>, <i>AnoplognathidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., they are perfectly
parallel, and in the former often inflexed<a name="FNanchor_2100_2100" id="FNanchor_2100_2100"></a><a href="#Footnote_2100_2100" class="fnanchor">[2100]</a>. With regard
to <i>other</i> appendages of the part we are treating of, if you
examine the stag-beetle and many other Lamellicorns,
you will find between the claws a minute but conspicuous
joint terminated by two bristles which seem to mimic
the <i>ungula</i> and its claws; these parts are what are denominated
in the table the <i>palmula</i>, <i>plantula</i>, and <i>pseudonychia</i>:
in the stag-beetle these are long<a name="FNanchor_2101_2101" id="FNanchor_2101_2101"></a><a href="#Footnote_2101_2101" class="fnanchor">[2101]</a>; in the <i>MelolonthidÃ¦</i>
short<a name="FNanchor_2102_2102" id="FNanchor_2102_2102"></a><a href="#Footnote_2102_2102" class="fnanchor">[2102]</a>; and in many <i>CetoniadÃ¦</i> they resemble an
intermediate claw.</p>

<p>The most remarkable of the <i>appendages</i> of the <i>tarsi</i> are
to be looked for on their under side or sole (<i>solea</i>), and
are the means by which numbers of insects can overcome
atmospheric pressure and walk against gravity. Many
of these have been fully described in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_2103_2103" id="FNanchor_2103_2103"></a><a href="#Footnote_2103_2103" class="fnanchor">[2103]</a>;
but much that relates to them was there omitted,
which I shall now detail to you. <i>Four</i> kinds of <i>pulvilli</i>,
as I would call these appendages, are found in the sole
of insects, upon each of which I shall make a few remarks.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i> is a <i>cushion</i> or brush composed of very thickly
set hairs or short bristles: examples of this you will find
in the majority of <i>Tetramerous</i> and <i>Trimerous</i> beetles. In
<i>Chrysomela</i>, <i>Timarcha</i>, &amp;c., there is <i>one</i> of these cushions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>
on each of the <i>three</i> first joints; in <i>Prionus</i>, <i>Liparus</i>,
&amp;c., there is a pair; and in <i>Coccinella</i> on the <i>two</i> first; in
others (<i>Balaninus Nucum</i>, &amp;c.) a pair only on the penultimate
joint; in <i>Calandra Palmarum</i>, <i>Rhina barbirostris</i>,
&amp;c., that joint has an intire cushion; in <i>Eurynotus muricatus</i>
K.<a name="FNanchor_2104_2104" id="FNanchor_2104_2104"></a><a href="#Footnote_2104_2104" class="fnanchor">[2104]</a> the three first joints of the four anterior tarsi
are similarly circumstanced, but the cushions resemble
sponge<a name="FNanchor_2105_2105" id="FNanchor_2105_2105"></a><a href="#Footnote_2105_2105" class="fnanchor">[2105]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> kind of cushion is a vesicular <i>membrane</i>
capable of being inflated. This distinguishes the tarsi
of <i>Thrips</i><a name="FNanchor_2106_2106" id="FNanchor_2106_2106"></a><a href="#Footnote_2106_2106" class="fnanchor">[2106]</a>, and many <i>Acari</i> L.<a name="FNanchor_2107_2107" id="FNanchor_2107_2107"></a><a href="#Footnote_2107_2107" class="fnanchor">[2107]</a>; likewise those of
<i>Xenos</i><a name="FNanchor_2108_2108" id="FNanchor_2108_2108"></a><a href="#Footnote_2108_2108" class="fnanchor">[2108]</a>; and also of many <i>Orthoptera</i> fully described on
a former occasion<a name="FNanchor_2109_2109" id="FNanchor_2109_2109"></a><a href="#Footnote_2109_2109" class="fnanchor">[2109]</a>, though the fact of their capacity of
inflation has not been ascertained, belong to this section.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> kind of covering of the sole is when the
three or four first joints of the <i>tarsus</i> each terminate in
<i>one</i> or <i>two</i> membranous lobes or appendages: of the first
description is <i>Priocera</i> K., in which the lobes are involute<a name="FNanchor_2110_2110" id="FNanchor_2110_2110"></a><a href="#Footnote_2110_2110" class="fnanchor">[2110]</a>;
and of the second <i>Rhipicera</i> Latr.<a name="FNanchor_2111_2111" id="FNanchor_2111_2111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2111_2111" class="fnanchor">[2111]</a>, in which
there is a pair on each joint, in the Brazil species set
with very fine hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> and last kind are what may with the utmost
propriety be denominated <i>suckers</i>, since their use as such
is clearly ascertained. These are not only to be found
in a large proportion of the <i>Diptera</i>, in some of which
there are <i>two</i> of them, as in the <i>AsilidÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_2112_2112" id="FNanchor_2112_2112"></a><a href="#Footnote_2112_2112" class="fnanchor">[2112]</a>; and in others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span>
<i>three</i>, as the <i>TabanidÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_2113_2113" id="FNanchor_2113_2113"></a><a href="#Footnote_2113_2113" class="fnanchor">[2113]</a>; but also in many of the subsequent
Orders: thus, in the Heteropterous <i>Hemiptera</i>, in
<i>Scutellera</i> and <i>Pentatoma</i>, but not the <i>ReduviadÃ¦</i>, and
in the Neuropterous genus <i>Nymphes</i> Leach there is a minute
one under each claw. It is discoverable between the
claws in many <i>Hymenoptera</i>, as <i>Apis</i><a name="FNanchor_2114_2114" id="FNanchor_2114_2114"></a><a href="#Footnote_2114_2114" class="fnanchor">[2114]</a>, <i>Vespa</i>, &amp;c. But
the genus that exhibits to the curious Entomologist the
most singular and elaborate apparatus of this kind is
<i>Dytiscus</i> Latr.; and the examination of the under side of
the <i>hand</i> of any <i>male</i> of this genus will almost compel the
most inattentive observer to glorify the wisdom and skill
of the <span class="smcap">Allfather</span> so conspicuously manifested in the
structure of these complex organs. For this part in these,
instead of two or three pedunculate cups as in the insects
just mentioned, is composed of a vast number, some
large and some small. If you take a male specimen of
the common <i>D. marginalis</i>, you will find that the three
first joints of the hand are very much dilated, so as to
form a plate or shield nearly circular, fringed all round
with stiffish hairs; if you next examine the under side of
this plate with a good magnifier, you will discover at the
base, where it is united to the cubit, two circular cups,
the external one more than three times the size of the
other, with an umbilicated centre<a name="FNanchor_2115_2115" id="FNanchor_2115_2115"></a><a href="#Footnote_2115_2115" class="fnanchor">[2115]</a>; besides these two
larger cups the rest of the shield is covered by a vast
number of minute ones of a similar construction<a name="FNanchor_2116_2116" id="FNanchor_2116_2116"></a><a href="#Footnote_2116_2116" class="fnanchor">[2116]</a>: the
larger cups are nearly sessile, but the smaller are
elevated upon a tubular footstalk<a name="FNanchor_2117_2117" id="FNanchor_2117_2117"></a><a href="#Footnote_2117_2117" class="fnanchor">[2117]</a>; the three first joints
of the intermediate <i>tarsi</i> are also dilated, but not into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span>
orbicular shield, and thickly set with minute pedunculated
suckers<a name="FNanchor_2118_2118" id="FNanchor_2118_2118"></a><a href="#Footnote_2118_2118" class="fnanchor">[2118]</a>. The structure varies however in different
species. Thus in <i>D. limbatus</i> the shield is triangular
with the smaller suckers at the base, and two rows
of larger oblong ones, concave but not umbilicated, at the
apex; in another Brazilian undescribed species (<i>D. obovatus</i>
K. MS.) the shield is oblong and quite covered
with suckers like those last mentioned; in <i>D. sulcatus</i> (<i>Acilius</i>
Leach) almost the whole plate is occupied by a very
large sucker, above which, at some distance in the inner
side, are two smaller ones, while the extremity of the
shield is covered by minute ones elevated on long footstalks:
the central umbilicated elevation of the large one,
which nearly fills its cavity, is in this species beautifully
radiated. The male of <i>Colymbetes transversalis</i> has also
an orbicular shield, but the suckers are much less strongly
marked. The use of this organ has been before sufficiently
explained<a name="FNanchor_2119_2119" id="FNanchor_2119_2119"></a><a href="#Footnote_2119_2119" class="fnanchor">[2119]</a>.</p>

<p>A few words will be necessary upon the <i>folding</i> of the
legs in <i>repose</i>. When insects <i>walk</i>, the thigh is usually
in an <i>ascending</i> position, rising <i>above</i> the horizontal line,
the <i>tibia</i> forming with it rather an obtuse angle, and the
<i>tarsus</i> nearly a right one with the <i>tibia</i>; but in the Myriapods,
as far as I can unravel their swift many-footed
motions, these angles in walking do not take place; in
repose however, in many insects, the <i>coxa</i> forms an angle
with the thigh <i>below</i> the horizontal line and with the <i>tibia</i>
above it, and the <i>tibia</i> and <i>tarsus</i> continue in the same
line, and point downwards nearly vertically; in others,
as in the <i>Tetramerous</i> beetles, the last-mentioned joints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span>
form an angle with each other and turn upwards, the <i>tibia</i>
having an external oblique cavity to permit this; but the
insects most remarkable for packing close their legs are
those carnivorous genera <i>Dermestes</i>, <i>Anthrenus</i>, <i>Byrrhus</i>,
&amp;c. In the last-mentioned genus there are cavities in
the under side of the trunk, in each division of the
breast, and at the base of the abdomen, to receive the
legs when folded; the <i>coxÃ¦</i> have also a cavity to receive
the <i>base</i> of the thigh. In the <i>anterior</i> legs this last part
has a longitudinal one on its <i>upper</i> side, and in the
four <i>posterior</i> on the <i>under</i>, which receives the <i>tibiÃ¦</i>,
which at the inner edge are straight, and at the outer
curvilinear, and the <i>tarsi</i> are turned up and received by
the concave part, on the <i>anterior</i> side of the <i>first</i> pair
and the <i>posterior</i> side of the two <i>last</i> of the <i>tibiÃ¦</i>, so as
to lie between it and the body: when the legs are close
packed, the animal looks almost as if it had none. I
have observed that when <i>Dytisci</i> repose on the water,
the posterior legs are turned up and laid over the elytra,
and curved towards the head.</p>


<p>vi. <i>Pectines.</i> I must next say a few words upon a remarkable
organ, which seems in some degree supplementary
to the <i>legs</i>, by which the <span class="smcap">Creator</span> has distinguished
the genus <i>Scorpio</i>, called from its parallel teeth, set in a
back, their <i>pecten</i> or comb<a name="FNanchor_2120_2120" id="FNanchor_2120_2120"></a><a href="#Footnote_2120_2120" class="fnanchor">[2120]</a>. This back consists of two
or more articulations, is attached by its anterior extremity
to the sides of the posterior piece of the <i>mesostethium</i>,
and is marked by a longitudinal furrow or channel. The
teeth, which vary in number in the different species, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>
in the same species at different periods of its growth, are
usually ovato-lanceolate, or obtusangular, furnished on
their exterior edge with what appears to be a longitudinal
sucker, and supported between their bases, or at the
base, both within and without, by triangular, conical, or
subglobose props. With regard to the <i>use</i> of these organs,
it has not been clearly ascertained. Amouroux states
that he has seen the animals use them as feet, and he conjectures
that by them they may fix themselves and turn
upon them as on a pivot, when they have to make a retrograde
movement<a name="FNanchor_2121_2121" id="FNanchor_2121_2121"></a><a href="#Footnote_2121_2121" class="fnanchor">[2121]</a>. M. Latreille, from their having
branchial pouches immediately under them, seems to
think that they are connected with respiration<a name="FNanchor_2122_2122" id="FNanchor_2122_2122"></a><a href="#Footnote_2122_2122" class="fnanchor">[2122]</a>. This
may be true; but from the suckers just described, I am
inclined to think with Amouroux, that they are useful to
the animal in its <i>motions</i>, and that like the suckers of the
Gecko, flies, &amp;c., they enable it to support itself against
gravity and to climb perpendicular surfaces.</p>

<p>Whether the five obtriangular plates, elevated on a
pedicle, which are found arranged in a series on the under

<h3>EXTERNAL ANATOMY OF INSECTS CONTINUED.</h3>

<h5>THE ABDOMEN, AND ITS PARTS.</h5>


<p>The <i>abdomen</i> of insects, which we are next to consider,
is the <i>third</i> great section of the body, and is the seat of
the organs of generation, as well as of a principal part
of those connected with respiration. My remarks upon
it will be under the following heads: Its <i>substance</i>; <i>articulation
with the trunk</i>; <i>composition</i>; <i>shape and proportions</i>;
its <i>appendages</i>; and its <i>clothing</i>.</p>

<p>i. <i>Substance.</i> Under this head I may observe in general,
that where the abdomen is protected by <i>hard</i> elytra
or tegmina, as in most <i>Coleoptera</i>, and many Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, the <i>upper</i> side is generally of a softer
and more flexible substance than the <i>under</i>, which from
its exposure requires a greater degree of hardness and
firmness to prevent its being injured. In some,&mdash;as the
<i>DynastidÃ¦</i> and those beetles whose elytra are connate,
or as it were soldered together, the former is scarcely
more than <i>membrane</i>. In others of the above tribes,
nearly the <i>whole</i> of the back of whose abdomen, as in <i>Staphylinus</i>;
or only its anal <i>extremity</i>, as in <i>Melolontha</i>; or
its <i>sides</i>, as in <i>LygÃ¦us</i>, &amp;c., is not covered by the elytra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span>
or tegmina, that part, as was requisite for its protection,
is harder than the covered portion.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Articulation with the trunk.</i> Two distinct modes
of this articulation take place:&mdash;in the first the abdomen
is united to the trunk by the <i>whole</i> diameter of its base,
without any appearance of incision; in the other only a
<i>small part</i> of that diameter, with a very visible incision.
All the Orders, except the majority of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
and <i>Diptera</i>, and the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i>, belong to the <i>first</i> of
these sections; for in all these the aperture by which the
abdomen is suspended to the trunk, occupies the whole
of the base; I say <i>suspended</i>, because, though in many
cases it inosculates in the posterior cavity of the latter
part, it does not in all, and the margins of the orifice are
united by ligament to those of that cavity. Indeed, in
the <i>Coleoptera</i> and others that have a somewhat prominent
metaphragm<a name="FNanchor_2125_2125" id="FNanchor_2125_2125"></a><a href="#Footnote_2125_2125" class="fnanchor">[2125]</a>, the trunk may with more propriety
be said to inosculate in the abdomen. With regard
to the <i>second</i> section,&mdash;those in which the orifice is
of less diameter than the base, occupying only a portion
of it,&mdash;it may be further subdivided into those whose abdomen
is <i>sessile</i>, and those in which it is united to the
trunk by the intervention of a long or short <i>pedicle</i> or
footstalk: to the first of these subdivisions belong all
those <i>Diptera</i> that have an incision between the trunk
and abdomen&mdash;for many tribes of this Order, as the <i>TipulidÃ¦</i>,
<i>AsilidÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., belong rather to the <i>first</i> section&mdash;and
the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i>; the abdomen, however, in <i>all</i> is merely
suspended, without any inosculation. To the <i>second</i>
subdivision belong all the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, except the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span>
<i>TenthredinidÃ¦</i> and <i>SiricidÃ¦</i>, the abdomen of which is united
to the trunk by the whole diameter of its base; these
may be further subdivided into those that have a very
<i>short</i> pedicle and those that have a <i>long</i> one; but as
the mode of articulation in both these is the same,
there will be no necessity to consider them separately.
M. Cuvier has included the <i>Diptera</i> and <i>AraneidÃ¦</i> in
the same tribe with such <i>Hymenoptera</i> as have a petiolate
abdomen<a name="FNanchor_2126_2126" id="FNanchor_2126_2126"></a><a href="#Footnote_2126_2126" class="fnanchor">[2126]</a>; but as the manner in which the latter
articulates with the trunk is widely different from that of
the <i>Diptera</i> &amp;c., I thought it best to consider them as
distinct; especially as in the <i>Diptera</i> there is no tendency
to a pedicle, while only the above two tribes of <i>Hymenoptera</i>
are wholly without it. This learned author thus describes
the articulation where the abdomen is connected
by a pedicle. "They have," says he, "a real solid articulation,
a kind of hinge in which the first segment is
emarginate above, and receives a saliant portion of the
trunk upon which it moves; this articulation is rendered
solid by elastic and powerful ligaments; muscles
which have their attachment in the interior of the trunk
are inserted in this first segment, and determine the extent
of its movement<a href="#Footnote_2126_2126" class="fnanchor">[2126]</a>." But this passage by no means
conveys an adequate idea of the singular mechanism by
which the <i>Divine Artificer</i> has enabled these little creatures
to impart the necessary movements to an organ so
bulky compared with its very diminutive point of attachment.
As no author that has fallen in my way has examined
the articulation of the abdomen with the trunk in
these <i>Hymenoptera</i> with the attention which it merits<a name="FNanchor_2127_2127" id="FNanchor_2127_2127"></a><a href="#Footnote_2127_2127" class="fnanchor">[2127]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span>
I shall enlarge a little upon it. You would be surprised,
and not without reason incredulous, were I seriously to
assert that these insects lift their weighty posteriors
by means of a <i>rope</i> and <i>pulley</i>; yet something like this
really does take place, though not with all in a manner
equally striking. The point of articulation in the insects
in question, except in <i>Evania</i>, is at the base of the metathorax
just above the posterior pair of legs: here you see
a small orifice, either insulated or connected by a narrow
opening with the larger one, when the abdomen is removed,
which in many instances, as in the common wasp,
is surmounted by another still smaller, through which,
if you examine it attentively, you will find there is transmitted
a flat and sometimes broadish ligament or rather
<i>tendon</i>, in which the levator muscles of the abdomen, attached
by their other end to the metaphragm<a name="FNanchor_2128_2128" id="FNanchor_2128_2128"></a><a href="#Footnote_2128_2128" class="fnanchor">[2128]</a>, terminate:
another minute orifice above the base of the pedicle affords
a point of attachment to the tendon, so as to give
it prize upon the abdomen. Here the upper orifice in
the trunk is the <i>pulley</i> (<i>trochlea</i>)<a name="FNanchor_2129_2129" id="FNanchor_2129_2129"></a><a href="#Footnote_2129_2129" class="fnanchor">[2129]</a>, the tendon is the
<i>rope</i> (<i>funiculus</i>)<a href="#Footnote_2129_2129" class="fnanchor">[2129]</a>, and the abdomen is the weight to be
lifted. When the muscles contract, the tendon, running
over the edge of the aperture, is pulled in, and the part
just named is elevated; and when they are relaxed the
tendon is let out, and it falls. Some little variation in
the structure takes place in different tribes: thus, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span>
<i>FormicidÃ¦</i>, <i>ScoliadÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., instead of a separate orifice,
the part I call the pulley is merely an upper sinus of the
large orifice that receives the pedicle of the abdomen.
The shape of these orifices, both of the trunk and abdomen,
varies in different genera: thus, in the bee it is triangular,
with the vertex reversed; and in the wasp the
upper one is circular, and the lower one transversely oblong;
but in all, the apertures of the trunk correspond
with those of the abdomen. In <i>Evania</i>, in which the
minute abdomen is inserted in the upper side of the metathorax,
there is scarcely any trace of this structure.
With regard to the articulation of the pedicle itself with
the lower orifice of the trunk, it appears simply suspended,
with little or no inosculation. I may observe
under this head, that though the abdomen in almost all
insects is wholly clear of the cavity of the trunk, yet in
some <i>PhalangidÃ¦</i> (<i>Gonyleptes</i> K.) it appears almost retracted
within it<a name="FNanchor_2130_2130" id="FNanchor_2130_2130"></a><a href="#Footnote_2130_2130" class="fnanchor">[2130]</a>.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Composition.</i> I shall next consider the <i>segments</i>
into which the abdomen is usually divided, their number,
and other circumstances connected with them. In
the <i>HippoboscidÃ¦</i>, <i>AcaridÃ¦</i>, <i>PhalangidÃ¦</i>, and <i>AraneidÃ¦</i>,
the part we are considering is not divided into segments,
though in some instances, as in <i>Gonyleptes</i> and the cancriform
<i>EpeirÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_2131_2131" id="FNanchor_2131_2131"></a><a href="#Footnote_2131_2131" class="fnanchor">[2131]</a>, they are represented by <i>folds</i>; but in
the great majority of insects it consists of several dorsal
and ventral pieces or segments, forming by their union
the <i>annuli</i> or rings into which it appears divided. The
<i>number</i> of these abdominal segments varies in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span>
insects; I have noticed more than <i>twenty</i> such variations,
and probably there are many more. Before I give you
them in detail, I must first observe that the dorsal and
ventral segments, though sometimes they correspond in
number, yet very often do not, the dorsal most commonly
exceeding the ventral by a segment; in a few
cases however the reverse takes place. In the sexes also
there is frequently a difference in the number of segments,
as has been before observed<a name="FNanchor_2132_2132" id="FNanchor_2132_2132"></a><a href="#Footnote_2132_2132" class="fnanchor">[2132]</a>. I shall express
the variations in question by two figures, the <i>first</i> representing
the number of <i>dorsal</i> segments, and the <i>second</i>
the <i>ventral</i>&mdash;they usually only express the <i>apparent</i> segments:
perhaps a very general examination and dissection
might bring many of them nearer to a common
type.</p>

<p>I shall next explain the articulation of the segments
with each other, both that of the rings formed by the
union of the dorsal and ventral pieces, and that of those
pieces themselves. In general it may be stated with respect
to the former, that each ring is suspended by ligament
to that which precedes it; but this takes place in
<i>three</i> ways&mdash;in some the margins of the suspended rings
<i>touch</i> each other only, with little or no <i>inosculation</i>;
in others the <i>dorsal</i> segments only touch, and the base
of each <i>ventral</i> is covered more or less by the apex of
the preceding one; and in others again the base of the
whole ring, both above and below, is so covered, or
inosculates. The first kind here mentioned you will
find exemplified in <i>Melolontha</i>, <i>Geotrupes</i>, <i>Musca</i>, &amp;c.;
the second in <i>Scorpio</i>; and the third in <i>Staphylinus</i>, the
<i>Hymenoptera</i>, and many others. In the <i>Coleoptera</i>, says
M. Cuvier, speaking of the movements of the abdomen,
the rings only touch each other at the margin, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span>
movement is very limited; whilst in the <i>Hymenoptera</i>
they are so many little hoops, which inosculate in each
other as the tubes of a telescope, one third only of
their extent often appearing uncovered<a name="FNanchor_2136_2136" id="FNanchor_2136_2136"></a><a href="#Footnote_2136_2136" class="fnanchor">[2136]</a>. We see the
reason of this structure when we consider the calls they
have for greater powers of movement in this part in laying
their eggs, and annoying their enemies and assailants;
and also in the <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i> to enable them to
turn up their abdomen like a scorpion, both as a posture
of attack, and to fold their wings: in all cases, however,
as far as my observation goes, these animals, when they
want to lengthen this part, can disengage the rings from
almost all inosculation, so that no impediment remains
to any movement.</p>

<p>The articulation of the dorsal and ventral segments
with each other is next to be considered. In <i>Iulus</i>
and some <i>Centroti</i> the ring appears to be formed of
a single piece, with scarcely any trace of the existence of
any such division; it is however almost universal, and is
of <i>three</i> descriptions; in the first the dorsal segments are
united to the ventral <i>at</i> the lateral margin or edge of the
abdomen; in the second it is <i>above</i> this margin, and in the
third <i>below</i> it. You will find that in <i>Fulgora</i> and many
other Homopterous <i>Hemiptera</i> these segments unite at
the margin, as they do likewise in <i>Cimex lectularius</i> belonging
to the other Hemipterous section; but in the
rest of the Heteropterous tribes, the ventral segments
turn upwards, and their union with the dorsal is in the
back of the abdomen; in these the <i>Hemelytra</i> and wings
only cover the dorsal segments, leaving the edge, formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span>
of the ends of the ventral, uncovered. The Lamellicorn
beetles also, and many other <i>Coleoptera</i>, exhibit the
same structure. To the last description, in which the
dorsal segments turn down to meet the ventral, belong
the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Locusta</i> Leach; likewise <i>Sirex</i>, <i>Chrysis</i>,
and many other <i>Hymenoptera</i>. The articulation between
these segments is by means of an elastic membranous
ligament, which usually is not externally visible; but in
many instances, in which the connecting ligament is of a
firmer substance, as in <i>Scorpio</i>, <i>Thelyphonus</i>, and <i>Phrynus</i>,
it is very conspicuous, and in the latter genus exhibits
many longitudinal folds, as it does likewise in <i>Gryllotalpa</i>,
which must permit a vast extension of the abdomen.
In this membrane, in some cases, as in <i>Dynastes</i>
M<sup>c</sup>L., <i>Melolontha</i>, &amp;c., the two or three first spiracles
are fixed<a name="FNanchor_2137_2137" id="FNanchor_2137_2137"></a><a href="#Footnote_2137_2137" class="fnanchor">[2137]</a>. In the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and many other insects
the dorsal segments do not unite by their <i>margin</i> with the
ventral, but the <i>end</i> of each dorsal laps over that of the
corresponding ventral.</p>

<p><i>Dorsal segments</i><a name="FNanchor_2138_2138" id="FNanchor_2138_2138"></a><a href="#Footnote_2138_2138" class="fnanchor">[2138]</a>. I shall next notice the segments
<i>seriatim</i>, in the order of their occurrence, beginning
with the <i>dorsal</i> ones. The most remarkable circumstance
with respect to these that occurs to my recollection takes
place in the Cancroid spiders (<i>Epeira cancriformis</i>, <i>aculeata</i>,
&amp;c.), in which the back of the abdomen is formed
by a plate, in some extended in a transverse direction
(<i>E. cancriformis</i>), in others in a longitudinal one (<i>E.
aculeata</i>), of a much harder substance than the under
side and quite flat, set with strong sharp spines, in the
former species apparently moveable, and terminating behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span>
in a piece resembling in some measure the scutellum
of the <i>StratyomidÃ¦</i> and similarly armed with a pair of
spines<a name="FNanchor_2139_2139" id="FNanchor_2139_2139"></a><a href="#Footnote_2139_2139" class="fnanchor">[2139]</a>: in <i>E. aculeata</i> the sides of the abdomen, under
the plate, have a number of longitudinal folds like
those of <i>Phrynus</i>. In <i>Cryptocerus</i>, a genus of ants peculiar
to South America, the <i>first</i> segment, not reckoning
the pedicle, forms almost the whole back of the abdomen,
and the three last are so minute as scarcely to be distinguishable.
Nothing very remarkable is exhibited by the
other segments, except that in <i>Trichius</i> the <i>penultimate</i>
is the largest; in some <i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i> (<i>S. splendens</i>) and
<i>Brachini</i> (<i>B. melanocephalus</i>) it is emarginate, and in the
former tribe also often terminating in a white membrane.
The <i>dorsal</i> segment most worthy of notice is the last, which
is called the <i>podex</i>; for though in general it is a minute
piece, often retracted within the abdomen and invisible,
as in many <i>Diptera</i>, yet sometimes it is the most conspicuous
of the dorsal segments. It is most commonly
triangular, and usually deflexed and forming an angle
with a horizontal line; but in <i>Clytra</i>, <i>Chlamys</i>, and
<i>Oryctes</i>, it is inflexed; in many Lamellicorns it is nearly
vertical. In <i>Tettigonia</i> F., many other Homopterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, and some <i>Hymenoptera</i> (<i>Cimbex</i>), its sides
turn down and become ventral; on its lower side it has
in these a longitudinal cavity which receives the ovipositor
in repose<a name="FNanchor_2140_2140" id="FNanchor_2140_2140"></a><a href="#Footnote_2140_2140" class="fnanchor">[2140]</a>. In many other insects it unites with the
last ventral segment, the <i>hypopygium</i>, to form a tube
for that organ, as you will find in <i>Callidium violaceum</i><a name="FNanchor_2141_2141" id="FNanchor_2141_2141"></a><a href="#Footnote_2141_2141" class="fnanchor">[2141]</a>,
many <i>MuscidÃ¦</i>, and <i>Thelyphonus</i>. As to its <i>termination</i>
the podex is sometimes bifid, <i>Blatta</i>; bipartite, <i>Ranatra</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
mucronate, <i>Sirex</i>; acuminate, <i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, <i>Trichius
hemipterus</i>. Generally this part is flat; but the disk
is elevated or gibbous in <i>Oryctes</i> and some other Lamellicorns.
In the majority of the <i>Coleoptera</i> Order it
is quite covered by the wings and elytra; but in many of
the last-mentioned tribe, and sometimes the penultimate
segment also, it is not covered by them<a name="FNanchor_2142_2142" id="FNanchor_2142_2142"></a><a href="#Footnote_2142_2142" class="fnanchor">[2142]</a>. In some insects
the piece we are considering appears to consist of
<i>two</i> segments; in the male of <i>Locusta morbillosa</i> the
whole podex is rhomboidal, but it is formed by two triangular
pieces which articulate with each other; this
structure permits the more easy elevation of the terminal
one for the extrusion of the feces.</p>

<p><i>Ventral Segments</i><a name="FNanchor_2143_2143" id="FNanchor_2143_2143"></a><a href="#Footnote_2143_2143" class="fnanchor">[2143]</a>. We are now to turn our attention
to the <i>ventral</i> segments of the abdomen. The first
of them is what is called the <i>epigastrium</i><a name="FNanchor_2144_2144" id="FNanchor_2144_2144"></a><a href="#Footnote_2144_2144" class="fnanchor">[2144]</a> in the table.
This part, according to M. Chabrier, is of considerable
importance to the animal in flight, as, by its pressure
against the trunk, not only regulating the movements of
the abdomen, but as, in his opinion, contributing to push
forward the trunk<a name="FNanchor_2145_2145" id="FNanchor_2145_2145"></a><a href="#Footnote_2145_2145" class="fnanchor">[2145]</a> in the descent of the animal. It is
remarkable only in the <i>Coleoptera</i> and Heteropterous
<i>Hemiptera</i>, to which my observations upon it will be
confined. It may be stated as usually consisting of two
articulations, that nearest the trunk being narrow, and in
the Predaceous beetles<a name="FNanchor_2146_2146" id="FNanchor_2146_2146"></a><a href="#Footnote_2146_2146" class="fnanchor">[2146]</a>, as also in <i>Scutellera</i>, <i>Pentatoma</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>
&amp;c., interrupted in the middle<a name="FNanchor_2147_2147" id="FNanchor_2147_2147"></a><a href="#Footnote_2147_2147" class="fnanchor">[2147]</a>. In many <i>Lamellicorns</i>
this joint is concealed under the posterior <i>coxÃ¦</i>, and with
the anterior part of the second forms a hollow cavity for
their reception; this last joint is what is properly the
<i>Epigastrium</i>, the former, especially when distinct, being
called in the table the <i>Hypochondria</i>. In <i>Sagra</i> and
<i>Brentus</i> the <i>epigastrium</i> is particularly conspicuous for
its size, in the former occupying half, and in the latter
nearly two-thirds of the under side of the abdomen; but
in general it is distinguished from the remaining segments
only by the central mucro or point that terminates it
towards the trunk<a name="FNanchor_2148_2148" id="FNanchor_2148_2148"></a><a href="#Footnote_2148_2148" class="fnanchor">[2148]</a>, and which is received by a sinus of
the <i>metasternum</i>; this point is generally minute and triangular,
but in <i>Sagra</i> it is large and rounded at the
extremity, and in <i>Calandra</i> it terminates nearly in a
transverse line somewhat waving. It is most remarkable,
however, in some species of the Heteropterous genus
<i>Edessa</i> F.; for in <i>E. nigripes</i> and affinities it is a sharp
<i>sterniform</i> conical horn, which passing between the four
posterior legs covers the end of the <i>promuscis</i>. In fact,
this part appears a kind of abdominal <i>sternum</i>. In the
<i>CetoniadÃ¦</i>, &amp;c., the <i>Hypochondria</i> unite before this mucro,
and form a ridge which articulates with it, and dips
towards the abdominal cavity; in <i>Scolytus</i> the <i>epigastrium</i>
is much elevated from the rest of the ventral segments,
so that the under side of the abdomen appears as
if it were suddenly cut off, whence Herbst's awkward
though not inexpressive name, <i>Ekkoptogaster</i>; this part
in this genus has something of a posterior mucro.</p>

<p>The intermediate ventral segments exhibiting no very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span>
remarkable peculiarities, I shall pass them without further
notice, and call your attention to the last, which is
opposed to the <i>podex</i>, and which I have named the <i>hypopygium</i><a name="FNanchor_2149_2149" id="FNanchor_2149_2149"></a><a href="#Footnote_2149_2149" class="fnanchor">[2149]</a>.
Though usually a <i>single</i> small piece, in
<i>Edessa</i> and many <i>PentatomÃ¦</i> it consists of <i>several</i> plates;
and in <i>Trichius</i> it is very large: it is mostly <i>intire</i>, but
in the male <i>Dytisci</i> it is <i>cleft</i>; in <i>Lamia ocellata</i> trilobed;
in <i>Edessa</i> tripartite; in <i>Centrotus Taurus</i> it is boat-shaped
and hollowed out to receive the stalk of the ovipositor.
It is also generally in the same line with the
body, but in <i>Xenos</i> it is turned up and bent inwards<a name="FNanchor_2150_2150" id="FNanchor_2150_2150"></a><a href="#Footnote_2150_2150" class="fnanchor">[2150]</a>.</p>

<p>iv. <i>Shape.</i> With regard to <i>shape</i>, in some Orders the
abdomen varies considerably; but the most general form
is one that approaches to trigonal, so that a transverse
section will be a triangle, with the vertex more or less
obtuse, and the base more or less convex; some tendency
to this form will often be found even in those insects whose
abdomen appears almost as flat as a leaf, as in many
<i>Aradi</i>. In the hive-bee the transverse section is almost
an equilateral triangle; in <i>Belostoma grandis</i> the disk of
the under side of the part in question is longitudinally
elevated into a trigonal ridge, the section of which is an
equilateral triangle, the sides being quite flat. In general,
in the vertical section of an abdomen, the vertex of
the triangle points <i>downwards</i>, but in <i>Libellula</i> F. it
points <i>upwards</i>. In <i>Blatta</i> this section is nearly lanceolate;
in <i>Staphylinus olens</i> it is a segment of a circle with
the convex side downwards; in <i>Ãshna</i> F. with that side
upwards; and in <i>Agrion</i> the section is circular. In
<i>Copris</i>, <i>Ateuchus</i>, &amp;c., the abdomen is very short and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span>
thick; in <i>Staphylinus</i> slender and long; in <i>Aradus</i>, <i>Nepa</i>,
&amp;c., depressed and flat; compressed in <i>Ophion</i> and
<i>Evania</i>; conical in <i>C&#339;lyoxis</i>; rhomboidal in many
<i>Mantes</i>; boat-shaped in many <i>LygÃ¦i</i>; fusiform in various
<i>PapilionidÃ¦</i>; lanceolate in some <i>IchneumonidÃ¦</i>, falcate
in others; nearly round in <i>Diapria pupurascens</i>; ovate
in <i>Lyrops</i>; elliptical in <i>Andrena</i>; oblong in many <i>XylocopÃ¦</i>;
heart-shaped in the naked <i>EuglossÃ¦</i>; triangular
in <i>Dytiscus</i>; gibbous in <i>Flata</i>; and vaulted in <i>Chrysis</i>.
At its base it is truncated in <i>Sirex</i>; retuse in most <i>bees</i>;
forming the segment of a circle in <i>Andrena</i>; in general
sessile, but in the majority of <i>Hymenoptera</i>, as has been
already observed, terminating in a pedicle. The pedicle
is very short in the <i>AndrenidÃ¦</i> and <i>ApidÃ¦</i>; long in the
<i>SphecidÃ¦</i>; thick in the <i>FormicidÃ¦</i>; slender in <i>Evania</i>;
fusiform in <i>Pelecinus</i>; clavate in <i>Ammophila</i>; campanulate
in many <i>VespidÃ¦</i>; nodose in <i>Myrmica</i><a name="FNanchor_2151_2151" id="FNanchor_2151_2151"></a><a href="#Footnote_2151_2151" class="fnanchor">[2151]</a>; squamigerous
in <i>Formica</i><a name="FNanchor_2152_2152" id="FNanchor_2152_2152"></a><a href="#Footnote_2152_2152" class="fnanchor">[2152]</a>: it sometimes also consists of <i>two</i>
joints, as in <i>Ammophila</i> and many <i>VespidÃ¦</i>. As to
<i>margin</i>, some have none, as <i>Centrotus</i>; in others, as
<i>Dytiscus</i>, it is very narrow; in others again, wide and
flat, as in the <i>NepidÃ¦</i>; in <i>Staphylinus</i>, &amp;c., it is distinguishable
only on the upper side of the abdomen; in
<i>Locusta</i> Leach only on the under side, though mostly
intire; it is serrated in <i>Blatta</i>, sinuated in <i>Acanthia paradoxa</i>,
and crenated in <i>Cerceris</i>.</p>

<p>v. <i>Proportions.</i> These vary greatly in the different
tribes; in some the abdomen is long and slender, as in
<i>Locusta</i>, and <i>Staphylinus</i>; disproportionably so in a remarkable
degree in some <i>AgrionidÃ¦</i> from South America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</a></span>
as <i>A. lineare</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_2153_2153" id="FNanchor_2153_2153"></a><a href="#Footnote_2153_2153" class="fnanchor">[2153]</a>; in others it is extremely short and
thick, as in <i>Copris</i>, &amp;c.; a mere appendage in <i>Evania</i>;
it is shorter than the elytra in <i>Trox</i>; of the same length
in most beetles; longer in <i>Melolontha</i>, <i>Hister</i>, &amp;c.; disproportionably
so in <i>Staphylinus</i>: though usually of the
same width with the trunk, in many <i>MantidÃ¦</i> it is much
wider<a name="FNanchor_2154_2154" id="FNanchor_2154_2154"></a><a href="#Footnote_2154_2154" class="fnanchor">[2154]</a>; and more slender in the <i>Libellulina</i>, <i>Myrmeleon</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>vi. <i>Arms and Appendages</i><a name="FNanchor_2155_2155" id="FNanchor_2155_2155"></a><a href="#Footnote_2155_2155" class="fnanchor">[2155]</a>. These are various; and
may be considered under the following heads: <i>processes</i>;
<i>organs</i> of <i>respiration</i>, <i>motion</i> and <i>prehension</i>; <i>weapons</i>;
and other <i>anal appendages</i> the use of which is unknown.</p>

<p>1. <i>Processes.</i> Under this term I include all prominences
of whatever kind, whether <i>tubercles</i>, <i>teeth</i>, <i>spines</i>,
or <i>horns</i>, that arm any part of the abdomen. Many of
these are <i>sexual</i> characters, and have been sufficiently
described in a former letter<a name="FNanchor_2156_2156" id="FNanchor_2156_2156"></a><a href="#Footnote_2156_2156" class="fnanchor">[2156]</a>; I need not therefore detain
you long on this head. Of the first kind is a remarkable
elevation that distinguishes the second ventral segment
of <i>Scolytus Destructor</i> (<i>Ips Scolytus</i> Marsh.) or of a species
allied to it<a name="FNanchor_2157_2157" id="FNanchor_2157_2157"></a><a href="#Footnote_2157_2157" class="fnanchor">[2157]</a>; in <i>S. pygmÃ¦us</i> (<i>I. multistriatus</i> Marsh.) the
same segment is armed by a flat horizontal <i>tooth</i> or horn;
in an <i>Aradus</i> from Brazil, before alluded to<a name="FNanchor_2158_2158" id="FNanchor_2158_2158"></a><a href="#Footnote_2158_2158" class="fnanchor">[2158]</a> (<i>A. laminatus</i>
K. MS.), the margin of the abdomen is surrounded
by eight flat subquadrangular laminÃ¦; in another species
figured by Stoll<a name="FNanchor_2159_2159" id="FNanchor_2159_2159"></a><a href="#Footnote_2159_2159" class="fnanchor">[2159]</a>, it is cut out into bays by a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span>
denticulated teeth; and in <i>Acanthia paradoxa</i> by long
spinose lobes<a name="FNanchor_2160_2160" id="FNanchor_2160_2160"></a><a href="#Footnote_2160_2160" class="fnanchor">[2160]</a>. In <i>Edessa</i> F., another genus of bugs,
the abdomen usually terminates in four strong sharp
dentiform spines, the intermediate ones being the shortest,
and in some the <i>margin</i> is also armed with spines<a name="FNanchor_2161_2161" id="FNanchor_2161_2161"></a><a href="#Footnote_2161_2161" class="fnanchor">[2161]</a>;
occasionally the anal spines are very long<a name="FNanchor_2162_2162" id="FNanchor_2162_2162"></a><a href="#Footnote_2162_2162" class="fnanchor">[2162]</a>. In addition
to the ventral horns before mentioned that distinguish
the sexes of some insects<a name="FNanchor_2163_2163" id="FNanchor_2163_2163"></a><a href="#Footnote_2163_2163" class="fnanchor">[2163]</a>; the males of the genus <i>Conops</i>,
a two-winged fly, have, on the antepenultimate ventral
segment, a singular process, varying in length and shape
in the different species, standing nearly at right angles
with the belly, convex towards the trunk, and concave
towards the anus. De Geer supposes that with the anal
extremity this forms a forceps with which this fly seizes
the other sex<a name="FNanchor_2164_2164" id="FNanchor_2164_2164"></a><a href="#Footnote_2164_2164" class="fnanchor">[2164]</a>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Organs of respiration</i><a name="FNanchor_2165_2165" id="FNanchor_2165_2165"></a><a href="#Footnote_2165_2165" class="fnanchor">[2165]</a>. I shall defer my account
of the <i>spiracles</i>, and other external respiratory organs,
till I come to treat of the system of <i>respiration</i> in insects,
when every thing connected with that subject will be
most properly discussed; but there are certain appearances
in some insects, which at first sight seem to partake
of the same character, but which being really independent
of that vital function, may here have their place.
If you examine the abdomen of the mole-cricket (<i>Gryllotalpa
vulgaris</i>), you will easily discover the true spiracles
in the folds of the <i>pulmonarium</i>, which separates the back
of that part from the belly; if you next inspect the five
intermediate segments of the latter, you will discover
on each nearer the base a pair of oblique little channels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[Pg 714]</a></span>
which precisely resemble closed spiracles. These
may be denominated false or blind spiracles. Again, if
you examine the pupa of any <i>Scutellera</i> or <i>Pentatoma</i>,
in which tribe the true spiracles are <i>ventral</i>, you will
discover, placed in a square on the two or three intermediate
<i>dorsal</i> segments, four or six elevated points resembling
spiracles, but not perforated, connected often by
corrugations in the skin or crust<a name="FNanchor_2166_2166" id="FNanchor_2166_2166"></a><a href="#Footnote_2166_2166" class="fnanchor">[2166]</a>; in the larvÃ¦ also of
some <i>Reduvii</i> the first minute dorsal segment, at each
lateral extremity, has a similar elevation with a central
umbilicus precisely resembling a spiracle, but still not
perforated: another instance of false spiracles in this section
of the <i>Hemiptera</i>, is furnished by <i>Aradus laminatus</i>
before mentioned, in the perfect insect; between the
spiracle and the margin of each ventral segment is a
white round callus, with a dark point resembling a
perforation on its exterior side, and terminating internally
in a channel covered by membrane leading to the
disk of the segment, so that the whole in shape resembles
a tobacco-pipe<a name="FNanchor_2167_2167" id="FNanchor_2167_2167"></a><a href="#Footnote_2167_2167" class="fnanchor">[2167]</a>. A number of similar callosities
with a central impression, but without any channel, variously
disposed, are also to be found in another bug,
<i>Rhinuchus compressipes</i> K.<a name="FNanchor_2168_2168" id="FNanchor_2168_2168"></a><a href="#Footnote_2168_2168" class="fnanchor">[2168]</a> In the Homopterous section
of this Order, a series of impressed points, which
may be easily mistaken for spiracles, are to be discovered
on both sides of the abdomen, at the margin in <i>Centrotus</i>,
in which the real spiracles are quite concealed.</p>

<p>In spiders, as we learn from Treviranus, the open <i>ventral</i>
spiracles of the scorpion are replaced by pseudo-spiracles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[Pg 715]</a></span>
these in <i>Epeira Diadema</i> are three pair of small
black points: on the back of the abdomen also are <i>four</i>
pair, but in some species there are only <i>two</i><a name="FNanchor_2169_2169" id="FNanchor_2169_2169"></a><a href="#Footnote_2169_2169" class="fnanchor">[2169]</a>: the most remarkable,
however, are exhibited by the cancriform spiders
before noticed<a name="FNanchor_2170_2170" id="FNanchor_2170_2170"></a><a href="#Footnote_2170_2170" class="fnanchor">[2170]</a>: in <i>Epeira cancriformis</i>, in the plate
which covers the abdomen, they are dark red spots with
an elevated rim and centre<a name="FNanchor_2171_2171" id="FNanchor_2171_2171"></a><a href="#Footnote_2171_2171" class="fnanchor">[2171]</a> exactly resembling spiracles,
except that they are not perforated; there are twenty-four
of them, twenty arranged round the margin, and
four in a square in the disk.</p>

<p>3. <i>Organs of motion.</i> In a former letter you were
told that several insects are enabled to leap by means
of <i>organs</i> in their abdomen; I shall now describe such
of them as require further elucidation. I then said that
<i>Podura</i> and <i>Sminthurus</i>, two apterous genera, take their
leaps by means of an anal <i>fork</i><a name="FNanchor_2172_2172" id="FNanchor_2172_2172"></a><a href="#Footnote_2172_2172" class="fnanchor">[2172]</a>. In the former genus
the fork consists of a single piece attached to the under
side of the anus, and terminating in a pair of long slender
sharp processes which articulate with it and form the
fork or saltatorious instrument<a name="FNanchor_2173_2173" id="FNanchor_2173_2173"></a><a href="#Footnote_2173_2173" class="fnanchor">[2173]</a>. In <i>Sminthurus</i> the <i>tines</i>,
as they may be called, of the fork do not articulate with
the base, but are of the same piece and consist of two
joints, the terminal one being flat and obtuse<a name="FNanchor_2174_2174" id="FNanchor_2174_2174"></a><a href="#Footnote_2174_2174" class="fnanchor">[2174]</a>. <i>Machilis</i>
to the anal fork adds eight pair of ventral linear springs
(<i>Elastes</i>), which are covered with hair or scales, and terminate
in a bristle or two. I have on a former occasion
mentioned the natatorious laminÃ¦ with which the anus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</a></span>
of the larva of <i>Agrion</i> and of some <i>Diptera</i> is furnished<a name="FNanchor_2175_2175" id="FNanchor_2175_2175"></a><a href="#Footnote_2175_2175" class="fnanchor">[2175]</a>;
the same part in that of <i>Dytiscus</i> ends in a pair of tapering
organs, fringed on each side like the hind-legs of the
imago<a name="FNanchor_2176_2176" id="FNanchor_2176_2176"></a><a href="#Footnote_2176_2176" class="fnanchor">[2176]</a>, which doubtless assist it in swimming; those
respiratory foliaceous laminÃ¦ which so singularly distinguish
the abdomen of the larvÃ¦ of <i>Ephemera</i>, like the
legs of the Branchiopod <i>Crustacea</i>, are probably used in
some degree as fins, and aid their motions in the water<a name="FNanchor_2177_2177" id="FNanchor_2177_2177"></a><a href="#Footnote_2177_2177" class="fnanchor">[2177]</a>.
Under this head may also be mentioned the many-jointed
bristles that form the long tails<a name="FNanchor_2178_2178" id="FNanchor_2178_2178"></a><a href="#Footnote_2178_2178" class="fnanchor">[2178]</a> of the fly that proceeds
from these larvÃ¦, whose interesting history I long since
enlarged upon; for when they fly the two lateral ones
diverge from the central one, and perhaps perform the
same office as the tail feathers (<i>rectrices</i>) of birds. These
bristles are also to be found in <i>Machilis</i><a name="FNanchor_2179_2179" id="FNanchor_2179_2179"></a><a href="#Footnote_2179_2179" class="fnanchor">[2179]</a>, and probably,
as its <i>leaps</i> are almost as long as <i>flights</i>, for a similar
purpose, to steady their motion. I may here lastly state
that I once saw a <i>Cryptophagus</i> (<i>Corticaria</i> Marsh.), but
I forgot to note the species, walking upon my window,
which when it wanted to turn fixed itself to the glass by
an inflated anal vesicle, and so accomplished its purpose.</p>

<p>4. <i>Organs of Prehension</i><a name="FNanchor_2180_2180" id="FNanchor_2180_2180"></a><a href="#Footnote_2180_2180" class="fnanchor">[2180]</a>. The abdominal organs of
<i>prehension</i> are various; but as the great body of them are
connected with the sexual intercourse of insects, I shall
not consider them till I come to treat on that subject.
The only remarkable one that is common to both sexes
is that of the earwig, which is too well known to every
child to call for any long description. The external organs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</a></span>
of <i>oviposition</i> I shall also describe hereafter, and
likewise those of <i>secretion</i> that have not already been
noticed.</p>

<p>5. <i>Weapons.</i> As the <i>stings</i> of some <i>Hymenoptera</i> are
analogous to the <i>ovipositors</i> of the majority of that Order,
I shall consider them both together when I treat of the
sexual organs of insects; but there is one, and that a tremendous
one, not connected with those organs, which
may be noticed here. I mean the sting of the <i>scorpion</i>.
There appears to be some analogy between the poisonous
fangs of one tribe of the Ophidian reptiles<a name="FNanchor_2181_2181" id="FNanchor_2181_2181"></a><a href="#Footnote_2181_2181" class="fnanchor">[2181]</a>, the mandibulÃ¦
of spiders<a name="FNanchor_2182_2182" id="FNanchor_2182_2182"></a><a href="#Footnote_2182_2182" class="fnanchor">[2182]</a>, the second pair of pedipalps, or the
fangs of the <i>ScolopendridÃ¦</i><a name="FNanchor_2183_2183" id="FNanchor_2183_2183"></a><a href="#Footnote_2183_2183" class="fnanchor">[2183]</a>, and the organ in question<a name="FNanchor_2184_2184" id="FNanchor_2184_2184"></a><a href="#Footnote_2184_2184" class="fnanchor">[2184]</a>;
but the last possesses this peculiarity, that it is placed at
the opposite extremity of the body, where it is preceded
by a long jointed tail, which properly speaking is merely a
continuation of the abdomen, since the spinal marrow, the
intestinal canal, and the <i>pseudocardia</i>, are extended into it<a name="FNanchor_2185_2185" id="FNanchor_2185_2185"></a><a href="#Footnote_2185_2185" class="fnanchor">[2185]</a>.
Providence might have a double view in thus contracting
the dimensions of this part of the abdomen; in the first
place, the animal is by this enabled to turn its tail over its
back preparatory to its inflicting a wound, and in the second,
perhaps, this formation favours the sublimation of
the venom, the long tail acting as an alembic for that
purpose. This machine consists of six angular joints including
the sting, the last but one being the longest, and
the last inflated, as it were, at the base, and terminating
in a sharp subulato-conical point which curves downwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[Pg 718]</a></span>
and has an orifice in a channel at the end on each
side. Treviranus could not discover these orifices in the
sting of <i>Scorpio europÃ¦us</i><a name="FNanchor_2186_2186" id="FNanchor_2186_2186"></a><a href="#Footnote_2186_2186" class="fnanchor">[2186]</a>; they may however be readily
seen if viewed with a sufficiently high power, though not
under a common pocket microscope. Whether the very
slender, many-jointed, <i>real</i> tail of the remarkable genus
<i>Thelyphonus</i> is used in any respect as a <i>weapon</i>, has
not been ascertained: it is a filiform hairy organ consisting
in some specimens of more than <i>twenty</i> joints, the
first being very much larger than the rest<a name="FNanchor_2187_2187" id="FNanchor_2187_2187"></a><a href="#Footnote_2187_2187" class="fnanchor">[2187]</a>.</p>

<p>6. <i>Appendages</i><a name="FNanchor_2188_2188" id="FNanchor_2188_2188"></a><a href="#Footnote_2188_2188" class="fnanchor">[2188]</a>. We are lastly to advert to those
<i>appendages</i> of the abdomen of which the use is not at
present discovered. These are the styles (<i>styli</i>) of the
<i>StaphylinidÃ¦</i>; the leaflets (<i>foliola</i>) of the <i>Libellulina</i>;
the floret (<i>flosculus</i>) of the <i>FulgorÃ¦</i>; the <i>cerci</i> of the
<i>BlattidÃ¦</i> and <i>Gryllina</i>; and the threads (<i>fila</i>) of <i>Machilis</i>:
but having nothing important to add concerning
them, the definitions of those terms will give you a sufficiently
clear idea of them<a name="FNanchor_2189_2189" id="FNanchor_2189_2189"></a><a href="#Footnote_2189_2189" class="fnanchor">[2189]</a>. As they are common to
both sexes, if their use is connected with the sexual intercourse,
it must be similar to that which Treviranus
ascribes to the pectens of scorpions, they must be instruments
of excitement.</p>

<p>And now, after this long discourse on the External
Anatomy and structure of these little beings, you may
think perhaps at first that the subject is exhausted; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[Pg 719]</a></span>
that I must have discovered and described every part
and every variation of every part of the crust of an insect.
But when you go on to reflect what a comparatively
small number of these creatures have fallen under my
examination, and in those, after all my laborious and
painful researches, from my limited faculties and other
imperfections of our common nature, how much will
probably have eluded my notice, you may conclude that
thousands of facts still remain concealed to reward the
patient assiduity of future investigators. Such are the
immensity and variety of the works of the <span class="smcap">Creator</span> in
this department, that it would require a long life, and
fill volumes upon volumes, to discover and give a description
of all the peculiarities of structure of the insects
that are already known; and could all that exist<a name="FNanchor_2190_2190" id="FNanchor_2190_2190"></a><a href="#Footnote_2190_2190" class="fnanchor">[2190]</a> be so
studied and explained in full detail, the library that the
Calif Omar ordered to be burned at Alexandria could
scarcely have contained more books than would be required
to receive the results. But "who is sufficient
for these things<a name="FNanchor_2191_2191" id="FNanchor_2191_2191"></a><a href="#Footnote_2191_2191" class="fnanchor">[2191]</a>?" This is a question that the most able
and most experienced physiologist must often feel disposed
to put to himself when, lost in the intricate labyrinth
of the works of his Maker, he sees all things arranged,
"wheel within wheel," in an order that he can
only <i>partially</i> unravel, instead of tracing the "regular
confusion" through all its windings. But glimpses of
light, and points of irradiation, here and there discover
to <i>fragments</i> of the truth of things, and such vestiges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[Pg 720]</a></span>
of the grand system of the <span class="smcap">Deity</span>, as enable him in some
degree to appreciate, and dispose him humbly to adore
that <span class="smcap">Wisdom</span>, <span class="smcap">Power</span>, and <span class="smcap">Goodness</span>, that at first
created and now sustains in its full beauty and harmony
the <span class="smcap">wondrous whole</span>.</p>

is most visible in the majority of the <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>
orders; next in some <i>Coleoptera</i>, as the <i>Lamellicorn</i> tribes, &amp;c. and
the <i>Lepidoptera</i>. Latreille is of opinion, that the two last segments
of the thorax in some insects are represented by the first of the
abdomen, and that the upper half segment of this part in <i>Coleoptera</i>
also represents the same. Latr. <i>De quelques Appendices, &amp;c.</i> <i>Annales
GÃ©nÃ©rales des Sciences Physiques.</i> A Bruxelles, vi. livrais, xviii.
14. In fact, in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, when the abdomen is separated from
the trunk, this segment usually remains attached to the latter. In
the <i>Myriapods</i>, the trunk is to be distinguished from the abdomen
only by its bearing the three first pair of legs.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> There is no general rule without exceptions, and no character is
so universal as to be distinctly exhibited by every member of a class
or other natural group. Thus, in the majority of the <i>mites</i> (<i>Acarus</i>
L.) the body is marked by no segments, and the only articulation or
incision is in the legs, palpi, &amp;c. But as the exception does not make
void the rule, so neither does the extenuation or absence of some
primary character at its points of junction with others, in some individuals,

insects breathe by tracheÃ¦, that there is no small difference in
the distribution of these organs. The <i>Trachean Arachnida</i> have only
a pair of spiracles, from which the tracheÃ¦ must <i>radiate</i>, if I may so
apply the term, in order to convey the necessary supply of air to every
part of the body. <i>Scutigera</i>, as far as I can discover, has only a <i>single</i>
series of <i>dorsal</i> spiracles (see <span class="smcap">Plate</span> <a href="../../43579/43579-h/43579-h.htm#PLATE_XXIX">XXIX.</a> <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 20)&mdash;an unusual situation
for them: in these also, to attain the above end, each trachea
must also radiate, so as to supply each part of the segment it is in.
Those of <i>Iulus</i>, according to the observations of Savi (<i>Osservaz. per
servire alla Storia di una Specie de Iulus</i>, &amp;c. 15&mdash;), consist of bundles
of parallel tracheÃ¦. Perhaps these circumstances would warrant the
considering of these <i>Arachnida</i> and the <i>Myriapoda</i> as primary classes?
The genus <i>Galeodes</i> is said to breathe by gills similar to those of the
<i>AraneidÃ¦</i>, which structure, probably, carries with it a system of circulation,
and exhibits a <i>third</i> type in the <i>Arachnida</i>, with four palpi,
six legs, and a distinct thorax. This genus, then, is the corresponding
point in the <i>Arachnida</i> to the <i>Hexapod Aptera</i>, as the <i>Scorpions</i> are
to the <i>CheliferidÃ¦</i> or Pseudo-Scorpions, and the <i>AraneidÃ¦</i> to the other
<i>Octopods</i>; and these analogies furnish a strong proof, that the <i>Tracheans</i>
belong rather to <i>Insecta</i> than <i>Arachnida</i>. Comp. <i>N. Dict.

papilio which, with the true wings of the genus, had a head without
antennÃ¦ or tongue, furnished with mandibles; and, in short, that of a
true caterpillar. It was a female, which deposited eggs that proved
barren. If this solitary instance was not a mistake, is it possible that
some parasitic larva had devoured only the inclosed head of the butterfly,
or so injured it that it could not reject the hard skin of the
larva, and yet not be destroyed?</p>

some <i>Dytisci</i>, <i>Staphylini</i>, and a few others, in which this part is quite
distinct: proving the erroneousness of the opinion of those German
entomologists, who consider the thorax as analogous to the neck of
other animals, and hence call it <i>Halsschild</i>. In some lepidopterous
larvÃ¦, however, as in that of <i>Pieris BrassicÃ¦</i>, though no visible neck
presents itself, one is very perceptible when the insect stretches the
head forward considerably. Reaum. i. 460.</p>

they are the most busily employed of all in arranging the threads of

prolegs, but in their stead a number of small transparent shining tubercles

has satisfactorily ascertained that it is the true larva of a <i>Tinea</i> of
LinnÃ©, but of a different habit from that of most subcutaneous ones),
has no true legs, and eighteen prolegs without any claws. Another
subcutaneous larva, for the history of which we are indebted to
M. Godeheu de Riville, is according to him entirely deprived of legs
of any kind (Bonnet ix. 196&mdash;.); as is another of the same tribe that
feeds on the poplar, an account of which is given by Goeze <i>Naturf.</i>

doubts. (See Kirby <i>Mon. Ap. Angl.</i> ii. 168, and Latreille <i>N. Dict.

a phial a vast number of the little insect which Goedart, Frisch, and
De Geer took for the larva of <i>Meloe ProscarabÃ¦us</i>, which he found
on the leaves of <i>Achillea Millefolium</i>. These little animals were
coursing each other with wonderful velocity over the sides of the
phial. To assist them in their motions, they applied to the surface
of the glass the end of their abdomen, using it, like many larvÃ¦ of
<i>Coleoptera</i>, as a seventh leg. This circumstance excited a suspicion
in the minds of both Mr. MacLeay sen., then visiting me, and myself,
that after all they might be <i>coleopterous</i> larvÃ¦. One, amongst
other circumstances, however, seemed to militate strongly against

and that of <i>Elater undulatus</i>. In the former, the last segment
is longer than the preceding one, terminating in a small acute mucro
at the apex, with a deep cavity, perhaps a spiracle, on each side, at
the base. In the latter, this segment is shorter than the preceding
one, forming above a nearly circular plate; the margin of which is a
little elevated, and armed on each side with three teeth, and at the
apex with a pair of furcate recurved horns, and without any basal
spiracle. De Geer iv. 156. <i>t.</i> v. <i>f.</i> 25. I have a similar larva, but not
the same species.</p>

(<i>Pieris CratÃ¦gi</i>), after devouring the exuviÃ¦ of the eggs from which
they were hatched, gnawed those which were not so: not, however, so as to destroy the included animal, but rather to facilitate its egress.
Those also of <i>Coccinella bipunctata</i> which I lately bred from the egg,
as soon as hatched began to devour the unhatched ones around them,
which they seemed to relish highly. I am inclined to believe, however,
that this unnatural procedure was to be attributed to the circumstance
of the female not having had it in her power to place her
eggs in the midst of <i>Aphides</i>, their proper food.</p>

<i>Bombyx camelina</i>, which I found upon the hazel, after a few days
produced sixteen grubs of some <i>Ichneumon</i>. At first these grubs were
green, but they became gradually paler; and after a day or two became
pupÃ¦. But I mention this circumstance here for another reason:
upon examining them after this last occurrence, I observed that
they adhered to the lid of the box in which I kept the larva, arranged
somewhat circularly; and at a little distance from the anus of each
was a pea-green mass, consisting of about eight oval granules, which
appeared like so many minute eggs. These were the excrement evacuated
by each grub previously to its becoming a pupa. The appearance
of this little group, with their verdant appendage, formed a curious
spectacle: they are still pupÃ¦, July 30, 1822.</p>

<i>Ichneumon Larvarum</i> L. retains its skin, which, he says, is so transparent
that the form of the nymph can be seen through it. Ibid. ii.
447. De Geer, however, found that this really did cast its skin,
which is so transparent as to be scarcely visible, by pushing it gradually
towards the anus, where it soon dries up and cannot then be discovered.
De Geer ii. 893&mdash;. According to RÃ¶sel the same circumstance
attends the transformation of <i>Coccinella renipustulata</i> Illig.
(<i>C. Cacti</i> Ent. Brit.), which at first perplexed him not a little. It is
probable that in this case the retention of the skin was accidental;
for some of the grubs of a <i>Mycetophila</i>, the transformation of which
I observed, became pupÃ¦ within their last skin, while others wholly
disengaged themselves from it. The cause of this variation, I conjectured,
arose from the former being too weak to extricate themselves
from the skin.</p>

Lamarck divides the pupÃ¦ of insects that undergo a metamorphosis
into three kinds, which he names&mdash;<i>Chrysalis</i>, <i>Mumia</i>, and <i>Nympha</i>.
</p>
<p>
i. <i>Chrysalis.</i> Under this denomination he includes all inactive
pupÃ¦ inclosed in an opaque puparium which entirely conceals them.
These he further subdivides into two kinds.
</p>
<p>
1. <i>Chrysalis signata.</i> This term is synonymous with the <i>Pupa
obtecta</i> of LinnÃ©, or the <i>Chrysalis</i> of <i>Lepidoptera</i> and some <i>Diptera</i>.
</p>
<p>
2. <i>Chrysalis dolioloides.</i> Equivalent to the <i>Pupa coarctata</i> Linn.
peculiar to those <i>Diptera</i> that assume this state in the skin of the
larva.
</p>
<p>
ii. <i>Mumia.</i> All inactive pupÃ¦ which are covered by a transparent
skin, through which all the parts of the inclosed imago may be seen,
subdivided also into two.
</p>
<p>
1. <i>Mumia coarctata.</i> Corresponding with the <i>Pupa incompleta</i>
Linn., which includes the <i>Coleoptera</i> and most of the <i>Hymenoptera</i>.
</p>
<p>
2. <i>Mumia pseudonympha</i>, confined to the Pupa of <i>Phryganea</i> and
some others. This might be named <i>Pupa subincompleta</i>.
</p>
<p>
iii. <i>Nympha.</i> Under this denomination are included all insects
that undergo only a partial metamorphosis, and are active in their
pupa state, corresponding with the <i>Pupa semicompleta</i> Linn. and also
<i>subsemicompleta</i> MacLeay. See <i>Anim. sans Vertebr.</i> iii. 285&mdash;.
</p>
<p>
M. Latreille has started an ingenious idea on this subject with regard
to these kinds of metamorphosis, which comprehends both larva
and pupa under a distinct denomination: as thus&mdash;
</p>
<ol>
<li class="pad"><i>Demilarve</i> and <i>Deminymph</i>, synonymous with the <i>Semicomplete Metamorphosis</i>.</li>
<li class="pad"><i>Larve</i> and <i>Nymph</i>, answering to <i>Incomplete Metamorphosis</i>.</li>
<li class="pad"><i>Caterpillar</i> and <i>Chrysalis</i>, answering to <i>Obtected Metamorphosis</i>.</li>
<li class="pad"><i>Vermilarve</i> and <i>Pupa</i>, answering to <i>Coarctate Metamorphosis</i>. <i>N. Dict. d'Hist. Nat.</i> xvi. 272.</li>

sur le Vol des Insectes</i> (<i>MÃ©m. du Mus.</i> 4ieme, ann. 325), having observed
a fluid in the interior of the nervures of the wings of insects,
thinks it probable that they can introduce it into them and withdraw
it at their pleasure: the object of which, he conjectures, is either to
strengthen them and facilitate their unfolding, or to vary the centre
of gravity in flight, and increase the intensity of the centrifugal force.</p>

under ground, in the trunks of trees, &amp;c., are often a

to RÃ¶sel, not less than three weeks.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_905_905" id="Footnote_905_905"></a><a href="#FNanchor_905_905"><span class="label">[905]</span></a> The doctrine of Epicurus&mdash;that the Deity concerns not himself
with the affairs of the world or its inhabitants, which, as Cicero has
judiciously observed (<i>De Nat. Deor.</i> 1. 1. ad calcem), while it acknowledges
a God in <i>words</i>, denies him in <i>reality</i>; has furnished
the original stock upon which most of these bitter fruits of modern infidelity are grafted. Nature, in the eyes of a large proportion of the
enemies of Revelation, occupies the place and does the work of its
Great Author. Thus Hume, when he writes against miracles, appears
to think that the Deity has delegated some or all of his powers
to nature, and will not interfere with that trust. <i>Essays</i>, ii. 75&mdash;.
And to name no more, Lamarck, treading in some measure in the
steps of Robinet (who supposes that all the links of the animal kingdom,
in which nature gradually ascends from low to high, were experiments
in her progress towards her great and ultimate aim&mdash;the
formation of man. Barclay <i>On Organization</i>, &amp;c. 263), thus states his
opinion: "La nature, dans toutes ses opÃ©rations, ne pouvant procÃ©der
que graduellement, n'a pu produire tous les animaux Ã -la-fois:
elle n'a d'abord formÃ© que les plus simples; et passant de ceux-ci
jusques aux plus composÃ©s, elle a Ã©tabli successivement en eux diffÃ©rens
systÃªmes d'organes particuliers, les a multipliÃ©s, en a augmentÃ©
de plus en plus l'Ã©nergie, et, les cumulant dans les plus parfaits, elle
a fait exister tous les animaux connus avec l'organisation et les facultÃ©s
que nous leur observons." (<i>Anim. sans VertÃ¨br.</i> i. 123.) Thus
denying to the Creator the glory of forming those works of creation,
the animal and vegetable kingdom (for he assigns to both the
same origin, <i>Ibid.</i> 83), in which his glorious attributes are most conspicuously
manifested; and ascribing them to nature, or <i>a certain
order of things</i>, as he defines it (214)&mdash;a blind power, that operates
necessarily (311); which he admits, however, to be the product of
the will of the Supreme Being (216). It is remarkable, that in his
earlier works, in which he broaches a similar opinion, we find no
mention of a Supreme Being. (See his <i>SystÃªme des Animaux sans VertÃ¨bres</i>,
Discours d'Ouverture.) Thus we may say that, like his forerunner
Epicurus, <i>Re tollit</i>, dum <i>oratione relinquit Deum.</i> But though
he ascribes all to <i>nature</i>; yet as the <i>immediate</i> cause of all the animal forms, he refers to the local circumstances, wants, and habits of
individual animals themselves; these he regards as the modifiers of
their organization and structure (162). To show the absurd nonplus
to which this his favourite theory has reduced him, it will only be necessary
to mention the individual instances which in different works
he adduces to exemplify it. In his <i>SystÃªme</i>, he supposes that the
web-footed birds (<i>Anseres</i>) acquired their natatory feet by frequently
separating their toes as far as possible from each other in their efforts
to swim. Thus the skin that unites these toes at their base contracted
a habit of stretching itself; and thus in time the web-foot of
the duck and the goose were produced. The waders (<i>GrallÃ¦</i>),
which, in order to procure their food, must <i>stand</i> in the water, but
do not love to <i>swim</i>, from their constant efforts to keep their bodies
from submersion, were in the habit of always stretching their legs
with this view, till they grew long enough to save them the trouble!!!
(13&mdash;). How the poor birds escaped drowning before they
had got their web feet and long legs, the author does not inform us.
In another work, which I have not now by me, I recollect he attributes
the long neck of the camelopard to its efforts to reach the
boughs of the mimosa, which, after the lapse of a few thousand years,
it at length accomplished!!! In his last work, he selects as an example
one of the <i>MolluscÃ¦</i>, which, as it moved along, felt an inclination
to explore by means of <i>touch</i> the bodies in its path: for this
purpose it caused the nervous and other fluids to move in masses
successively to certain points of its head, and thus in process of
time it acquired its horns or tentacula!! <i>Anim. sans VertÃ¨br.</i> i. 188.
It is grievous that this eminent zoologist, who in other respects
stands at the head of his science, should patronize notions so confessedly
absurd and childish.</p>

The part in this work regarded as the <i>mentum</i>, does not in all
cases accord with what MM. Latreille, Savigny, &amp;c. have regarded
as entitled to that denomination. Thus in <i>Hymenoptera</i>, their
<i>Mentum</i> is what we term the <i>Labium</i>, while our <i>Mentum</i> is the
small piece upon which that part sits (<span class="smcap">Plate</span> <a href="#PLATE_VII">VII.</a> <span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3. aÂ´Â´). This
is called the <i>Fulcrum</i> in <i>Mon. Ap. Angl.</i> (See i. Explan. of the
Plates.) Our Mentum may generally be known by its situation between
the hinges and base of the <i>MaxillÃ¦</i>.</p>

<i>Hymenoptera</i> has been usually regarded as the <i>Labium</i>; but surely that
organ which collects, and as it were <i>laps</i> the honey, and passes it
down to the <i>Pharynx</i>, is properly to be considered as the tongue.
The <i>Labium</i> itself appears to be represented by what has been called
the <i>Mentum</i>, and the true <i>Mentum</i>, as was lately observed, is at the
base of the part last mentioned, in the usual situation of that piece.
This, though long since noticed (Kirby <i>Mon. Ap. Angl.</i> i. 103&mdash;), has
not been much attended to by modern entomologists.</p>

its muscles do not appertain at all to the <i>Alitrunk</i>; whereas the <i>Collare</i>
as evidently is a part of the latter, its muscles belong to it, and
its functions in assisting in flight are important. These reasons, and
others we shall state hereafter, induced us long ago to consider this

of that extraordinary Coleopterous genus <i>Atractocerus</i> seem not to
have been so fully described as they deserve, I shall give here a minute
detail of their composition. They consist of <i>four</i> joints: the
first is wide and short, and somewhat platter-shaped; the second is
much smaller and shorter: the third is concavo-convex, or shaped
like a shallow bowl: towards the breast this joint is elevated, and
on the elevated edge sits the last joint, which is longer than all the
rest taken together. In my specimen it points towards the breast;
its under side is entire and slightly curved, but in the upper side are
two rows of lamellÃ¦ (<i>b</i>), placed alternately <i>nine</i> on each side, with an
odd one at the end: these lamellÃ¦ are full of minute papillÃ¦, and
furrowed on the side next the mouth. From between the first pair
a slender exarticulate hairy branch or appendage emerges (<i>a</i>), which
forms nearly a right angle with the main stem. The <i>labial palpi</i>
appear to consist of <i>three</i> joints; the two first very short, and the last
large, ovate, and acute. This description is not taken from <i>A. necydaloides</i>,
but from a Brazilian species more than five times its size,
which I have named <i>A. grandis</i>.</p>

is produced by the exit of the superfluous air from their thoracic

459. c. iv. 50.); and in the <i>Diptera</i>, in the <i>metathorax</i>, near the
poiser (c. i. 457). I observed myself lately, that <i>Elophilus tenax</i>,
if held by the anterior part of the body, when it hummed, alternately
opened and shut this spiracle. The wings during the sound
vibrated intensely. The hum ceased and was renewed, as they were
restrained from this motion or released from restraint; when the
wing was moved towards the head, a different sound was emitted from
that produced when it merely vibrated.</p>

investigation, he appears to admit that they assist in flight (<i>Annales
GÃ©nÃ©r. des Scienc. Phys.</i> VI. xviii. 8. Compare MacLeay, <i>Hor.

the name originally given to the Order. In the same place of
the work here quoted, M. Latreille also speaks of these <i>pseudelytra</i>,
as I would call them, as appendages of the <i>mesothorax</i>: but
whoever consults Mr. Bauer's admirable figures of <i>Xenos Peckii</i>
(<i>Linn. Trans.</i> xi. <i>t.</i> ix.), and is aware of the unimpeached and
minute accuracy of that admirable microscopic artist, will be convinced
that they belong to the <i>anterior</i> legs, and consequently to
the <i>prothorax</i>.</p>

to receive some confirmation from a circumstance overlooked when
the <i>larvÃ¦</i> of insects were treated of above (p. 130&mdash;), and to which
he alludes (411); namely, that in <i>that</i> state they consist of two segments
more than in the <i>imago</i>; these follow the three pedigerous
segments, have no pro-legs, and are supposed to belong to the trunk
rather than to the abdomen. To make this circumstance bear upon
the question, it must be proved that in the perfect insect these segments
in some manner become the back of the trunk and bear the
wings. This would not be more wonderful than many changes that
are known to occur in insects.</p>

first to have been acted upon in <i>Monogr. Apum Angl.</i> (1801), in which
those of <i>Hymenoptera</i> were stated to consist of three portions, viz.
<i>Basis</i>, <i>Medium</i>, <i>Apex</i> (i. 211.); which mode of dividing them was at
first adopted by M. Latreille (<i>Gen. Crust. et Ins</i>. iii. 226. Note 1.)
The same learned author (Ibid. iv. 239.), with regard to the <i>Diptera</i>,
made a near approximation to the plan of dividing wings into longitudinal
areas, but by the addition of a <i>basal</i> area, which interrupts
the attention to the communication of the areas with their <i>axes</i>, he
has rendered his system less perfect. Two of his terms&mdash;<i>Costal Area</i> and <i>Intermediate Area</i>, are here adopted; but his <i>Internal</i> is changed
to the <i>Anal</i> Area, for the term <i>internal</i> belongs rather to the base of
the wing. M. Latreille afterwards relinquished both these plans,

section, vary considerably in the number of their tarsal joints. Thus
in general in <i>Thanasimus</i> the <i>tarsi</i> are <i>pentamerous</i>; but in <i>T. formicarius</i>
they appear to be <i>heteromerous</i>; and in <i>Enoplium</i>, <i>Opilo</i>,
<i>Clerus</i> and <i>Necrobia</i> they are <i>tetramerous</i>. M. Latreille's expression,
(<i>N. Dict. d'Hist. Nat.</i> vii. 172.) "le premier article etant fort court et
cachÃ© sous le second," seems to indicate that there is a <i>fifth</i> joint in
some of these, the first being concealed under the second; but I have
never been able to discover it. Perhaps he reckoned the <i>pulvillus</i> as
a joint?</p>

several segments are retracted within the abdomen, and if the cavity
of its under side in the latter be examined, it will be discovered that
the <i>epigastrium</i> is divided in the middle into two pieces, and that both
the sides of this and the following segments are covered by three
narrow accessory plates, one to each, the last being the shortest.
De Geer (ii. 833.) describes <i>Chrysis ignita</i> as having <i>four</i> abdominal
rings; but this is only in <i>appearance</i>, there being really only <i>three</i>.
This appearance is produced by the apex of the last dorsal segment
being more depressed and marked with several deep little excavations
that look like holes. In some species of <i>Stilbum</i> this segment
consists as it were of three ridges or steps.</p>
